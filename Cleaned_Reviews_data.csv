0,my gf started playing before me  no option to create my own island and guys  being the 2nd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  you have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience  that s unacceptable 
1,while the game itself is great  really relaxing and gorgeous  i cannot ignore one thing that ruins the whole experience for me and a lot of other people as seen by the different user reviews that thing is nothat you only have 1 island per console  this decision limits to one person being able to enjoy the full experience  it also nukes any creative control of the island  since you havewhile the game itself is great  really relaxing and gorgeous  i cannot ignore one thing that ruins the whole experience for me and a lot of other people as seen by the different user reviews that thing is nothat you only have 1 island per console  this decision limits to one person being able to enjoy the full experience  it also nukes any creative control of the island  since you have the other usershouse and furniture  i hope nintendo can soon fix this big issue  because for now  this killed any intentions i had to play the game  expand
2,my wife and i were looking forward to playing this game when it released  i bought it  i let her play first she made an island and played for a bit  then i wouldecided to play only to discover that nintendo only allows one island per switch  not only that  the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do  so  if you have more than one personmy wife and i were looking forward to playing this game when it released  i bought it  i let her play first she made an island and played for a bit  then i wouldecided to play only to discover that nintendo only allows one island per switch  not only that  the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do  so  if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game  you need two switches  worst decision i have ever seen  this even beats ea congratulations nintendo  you have officially become the worst video game company this year  expand
3,we need equal values and opportunities for all players on the island  my wife is nothe first player  which is great but i wouldo not want to wait for her progress  at the same time  i wouldo not want her to have a a second class player experience if i am the founder  fix this nintendo 
4,beware   if you have multiple people in your house that want to play this game they can not each have their own account  island   only one customizable island can be played per switch   even if you buy two copies of the game you will still only be able to customize one island   i have 3 kids that want to play this game and they each want to customize their own island   and they cant beware   if you have multiple people in your house that want to play this game they can not each have their own account  island   only one customizable island can be played per switch   even if you buy two copies of the game you will still only be able to customize one island   i have 3 kids that want to play this game and they each want to customize their own island   and they cant    this is absolutely unacceptable   maybe the dumbest thing nintendo has ever done   i have owned every nintendo console since the original nes and i can not think of a worse decision by nintendo  expand
5,the limitation of one island per switch  not per cartridge  per switch  is nonsensical  it is obvious nintendo is just trying to sell more switch consoles  this means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent  player 2 can barely do anything  and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further  player 2 cannot make any administrative decisions the limitation of one island per switch  not per cartridge  per switch  is nonsensical  it is obvious nintendo is just trying to sell more switch consoles  this means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent  player 2 can barely do anything  and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further  player 2 cannot make any administrative decisions  players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources  i had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game sorry but this is an instant 0 10  the switch is a family oriented console and this is not a family oriented game  this is a colossal failure on nintendo s part  expand
6,i was very excited for this new installment of the animal crossing series  and i wish i could say that all the new bells and whistles and pretty graphics have made it the best ever  but nintendo made the worst decision they could have possible made for this game you can only have one island per switch  not per user profile  not per cartridge  per switch this game is supposed to bei was very excited for this new installment of the animal crossing series  and i wish i could say that all the new bells and whistles and pretty graphics have made it the best ever  but nintendo made the worst decision they could have possible made for this game you can only have one island per switch  not per user profile  not per cartridge  per switch this game is supposed to be zen  it is not supposed to be the reason for a spike in domestic homicides  having to share limited space with multiple family members competing for limited daily resources basically makes this game unplayable if  like a reasonable human  you only have one of these consoles in your family because they already have multiplayer support and you should not need more than one for everyone to enjoy a game nintendo needs to patch this  or else refund every person that isn t a single person household with this game  expand
7,it is 2020 and for some reason nintendo has decided that only one island is available per switch console  meaning my fiancé cannot progress the game beyond what i have done since i started my game first  she cannot place buildings down  she cannot obtain better tools until i have done it myself  why is she hamstrung  she has to have a lesser experience because of it  this is an utter joke andit is 2020 and for some reason nintendo has decided that only one island is available per switch console  meaning my fiancé cannot progress the game beyond what i have done since i started my game first  she cannot place buildings down  she cannot obtain better tools until i have done it myself  why is she hamstrung  she has to have a lesser experience because of it  this is an utter joke and i expect my money back  i am being pushed into buying a new console just so she can have the full experience  i will not be buying a whole new console just for that  this is shameful  expand
8,this is so annoying  only one player has the ability to play this game because only one island  nintendo does not deserve my money anymore 
9,i purchased this game for my household  me and my gf  and she started playing the game first  there was no advertisement or clear indication of this but each switch console is limited to one island and the first person on that island has a much better gaming experience than anyone else  anyone else that joins the island cannot build and building  set any mandates  and cannot progress ini purchased this game for my household  me and my gf  and she started playing the game first  there was no advertisement or clear indication of this but each switch console is limited to one island and the first person on that island has a much better gaming experience than anyone else  anyone else that joins the island cannot build and building  set any mandates  and cannot progress in the story  e g  getting tools  until the owner of the island does  there are also restrictions on what the second player can put in the musuem  there is no reason for there not to be a second game file for each profile on the switch and ninentdo attempt to push people to buy seperate consoles for this game is extremely greedy  gameplay is actually great but the severe limitations and no forewarning leads me to post this review to tell people not to buy this game if more than one person will play on the switch  expand
10,they heavily marketed this game as a social experience  a game to share with your friends and family  but heres the catch  you will need 1 nintendo switch for each player to get the full experience  i bought the game to share it with my girlfriend but the first player is considered as the founder of the island  and he is nothe one that will progress the story  that will unlock stuff and dothey heavily marketed this game as a social experience  a game to share with your friends and family  but heres the catch  you will need 1 nintendo switch for each player to get the full experience  i bought the game to share it with my girlfriend but the first player is considered as the founder of the island  and he is nothe one that will progress the story  that will unlock stuff and do all the cool things  the second nintendo switch profile will act merely as a villager  with little to no impact on the game and not able to progress without the founders progress  game ruined by greed  want to have the full experience  buy 2 physical copies and 2 nintendo switches  yeah thats what nintendo requires of you to play a social game if you want to be social  expand
11,you can only have one island per switch  if multiple people play on the same system  you will be tied to whoever started the first game s island  kinda kills any sort of independence 
12,only one island per console you cannot create a different island per user account once you have created an island on your console  all users have to share it good luck if you have two or more kids nintendo got away with forcing us to buy one game per user for years and years with pokemon and animal crossing  and now they want us to buy one console per user  they had theonly one island per console you cannot create a different island per user account once you have created an island on your console  all users have to share it good luck if you have two or more kids nintendo got away with forcing us to buy one game per user for years and years with pokemon and animal crossing  and now they want us to buy one console per user  they had the excuse of lack of memory space with cartridges  but with the switch  there is literally no good reason to do that but corporate greed that kind of practice should not be allowed seriously  shame on you nintendo  expand
13,you can only create one island per switch and anyone else that joins the island literally cannot progress until the person who created it does  greedy nintendo at it again 
14,one island per console is a pretty terrible and greedy design choice by nintendo  whoever is first on the island gets the full game experience and everyone else is gimped and cannot progress or do the same things 
15,why add local co op if you can only do one island and not have an option to split iscreen 
16,forcing there to only be 1 island per account completely ruins multiplayer for any family or residents that share a switch  the only way to enjoy this with your family is purchasing multiple switches  and that s completely ridiculous  there is no reason not to have the option of starting a new island  just shady business  the game is fun  unfortunately  not everyone who lives on the islandforcing there to only be 1 island per account completely ruins multiplayer for any family or residents that share a switch  the only way to enjoy this with your family is purchasing multiple switches  and that s completely ridiculous  there is no reason not to have the option of starting a new island  just shady business  the game is fun  unfortunately  not everyone who lives on the island will get to experience that  expand
17,if more than one person plays on a switch  even with seperate profiles you are forced to share not only the island but all the resources as well   anyone playing on a file after the first person to create a file is extremely limited as well   it is an absolute nightmare to play with more than one person 
18,it is absolutely ridiculous that the 5 members of my family that all share a switch have to only have one island  and on top of that the first person is nothe boss  you have really let me down nintendo and hope you get this fixed  also how is nothere no cloud save  welcome to 2020
19,one island per console ruined the game for me  after my girlfriend set up the island  i realized i am basically a guest in her island for pretty much anything now  it is not even proper sharing   she s the owner and i am her guest in the island i ll just let her play the game on her own and i ll play something else instead 
20,alright  so first things first the game itself is alright  however  if you have more than one person in your household only the founder will be able to enjoy it as supposed to  not only you can not have multiple islands  not even sure how to react on that in 2020  but also the first player gets all proper interactions  quests etc  if you share a console other players will be limited toalright  so first things first the game itself is alright  however  if you have more than one person in your household only the founder will be able to enjoy it as supposed to  not only you can not have multiple islands  not even sure how to react on that in 2020  but also the first player gets all proper interactions  quests etc  if you share a console other players will be limited to the progress of player 1 but what s worse is a local coop  the second player is basically a slave of the main one without inventory and even being able to proper pick up stuff  so you have to jump around the main player for usual exchange  not to mention the second player animation every time it picks sth up from the ground  like hey i found this  especially annoying when you have those quests like collect 200 sth  also  the second player is unable to do anything while the first one is in the inventory menu also  small things like not being able to rotate the camera or change the location of the tent are annoying idk to it iseems like nintendo tried to make ppl buy more consols or sth  disappointed  expand
21,as a fan of the saga this game is disappointing  animal crossing has to evolve and in this notitle i felt the same as always  the formula is very stagnant is like a 3ds upscaled game  not a real switch title 
22,this is nothe first animal crossing title that i have played  and although i am not a fan and i am not familiar with the practices and mechanics that are expected from games like this my opinion even if you wouldo not agree  is nothat it iseemed to me an extremely disappointing experience the objectives of the game are not clear  there are multiple tasks but none lead to a greater objective orthis is nothe first animal crossing title that i have played  and although i am not a fan and i am not familiar with the practices and mechanics that are expected from games like this my opinion even if you wouldo not agree  is nothat it iseemed to me an extremely disappointing experience the objectives of the game are not clear  there are multiple tasks but none lead to a greater objective or at least i wouldid not see any interesting narrative that was spun in the background  it is sad and embarrassing that having superior hardware such as the nintendo switch the developer has opted for that annoying world in perspective of roller and they would not make the jump to the more open world as other sagas have done there is still no voice acting and the characters keep talking with annoying sounds when this was once a technical limitation and now it is not  and the farming system seems to me sincerely the worst thing i have ever experienced  very boring and meaningless that is not to mention the awful decision to make that there can only be one island per switch  is not serious  this isn t a 3ds game  what annoyance you are forced to buy another system so that your family can play  in that aspect it iseems to me a total scam game absurdly overrated like almost all other nintendo exclusives  is nothe only thing i have to say  expand
23,the game is broken bugged right out the get go  i started a game progressed my island  etc  later in the day  my wife gets on the family console to play  and is nototally confused  the game only allows one person to play it on a console  the other profiles can only get a severely stripped down version of your island  no way to have their own profile  some fanboys claim this was on purpose the game is broken bugged right out the get go  i started a game progressed my island  etc  later in the day  my wife gets on the family console to play  and is nototally confused  the game only allows one person to play it on a console  the other profiles can only get a severely stripped down version of your island  no way to have their own profile  some fanboys claim this was on purpose  but i cant imagine nintendo would make this big of a mistake on purpose  once this huge bug gets fixed  i am happy to reevaluate the score  but this is a solid 0 10 for blocking other players from playing beyond the first to start a game on the console  expand
24,a good game  for sure  but only 1 island  with this limitation  to keep the interest longer  only my wife play half the payer  half the rating  i hope a change soon
25,same console multiplayer is severely limited  the game was designed so that only one person per family can actually get the full experience  do not buy this game if you want to play with multiple people 
26,cant stop playing 
27,im currently 18 hours in  with over 2 months worth of time skips  game seems worse than its predecessors  overall its a fun experience  but its limited in ways that i can only believe are to allow more copies to be sold before people can see the lack of content  im on my 4th house expansion with a town of 6  shop upgraded  and it iseems like im at the end of the museum collection  theim currently 18 hours in  with over 2 months worth of time skips  game seems worse than its predecessors  overall its a fun experience  but its limited in ways that i can only believe are to allow more copies to be sold before people can see the lack of content  im on my 4th house expansion with a town of 6  shop upgraded  and it iseems like im at the end of the museum collection  the little things that made the previous games feel special are missing  while new mechanics are in place to create a facade of advancement  tons of things are missing from previous games that have become staples  removal of the stat system for catches also removes half of the excitement of catching the same stuff over and over since you cant get a new best because size simply no longer exists  controls could have been improved alot for this game  there are no touch functions despite having alot of use in many areas  such as home design and patterns or basic inventory management  information is sparse  the game expects you to understand what your doing and why your doing it with zero direction for majority of the game  honestly if this was any other game it would score much lower and i have not even gotten into the multiplayer aspect both locally and online  expand
28,it is immensely disappointing to purchase the game and learn that there is very little value for a family  whereas i can share my other games with my children  the fact that only one of us can make true progress in the game is a letdown and just another example of nintendo being completely tone deaf and out of touch beyond this  though  the fact that few reviewers discuss this fact isit is immensely disappointing to purchase the game and learn that there is very little value for a family  whereas i can share my other games with my children  the fact that only one of us can make true progress in the game is a letdown and just another example of nintendo being completely tone deaf and out of touch beyond this  though  the fact that few reviewers discuss this fact is abhorrent  the game simply does not deserve the praise it is receiving from the media in the face of such a glaring misstep  highlighting their own massive blind spots at this point  while an okay but slow game  in the face of its price and the limitations its value drops far below far more mediocre games that are at least enjoyable more broadly  expand
29,my girls were so excited to get this game  i read nothing about because it does not interest me  once they started playing it they realised that there was only one island per switch  and my god  do they hate that  my girls are years apart and what appeals to one doesnt appeal to the other this limitation feels arbitrary and ill thought out i hope a patch fixes this
30,in the same way that detractors tried to defame and destroy pokémon 4 months ago with empty criteria  hypocrisy and personal caprices in an unfair way  the same thing i wouldo with this game to be a switch title i wouldo not think it has taken the leap in quality that we all expected  graphically it is limited  for some reason the geography of the world remains cylindrical and there is no freein the same way that detractors tried to defame and destroy pokémon 4 months ago with empty criteria  hypocrisy and personal caprices in an unfair way  the same thing i wouldo with this game to be a switch title i wouldo not think it has taken the leap in quality that we all expected  graphically it is limited  for some reason the geography of the world remains cylindrical and there is no free camera in the overworld  when this was previously justifiable for technical reasons  on switch it does not make sense that the game looks so simple animal crossing continues to have the same formula of 18 years ago  its last iteration only adds superficial changes but it is still the same  where is the evolution some mechanics have been replaced by others and that bothers me  and the progression system is quite clunky and poorly designed this should be the breath of the wild of animal crossing  but the map is still as limited as it has always been  the ideal animal crossing should be an open word but in that we have been disappointed there is almost no real graphic evolution and it looks like a 3ds game in hd  which is pathetic and wasted they had the opportunity to give a 180 degree turn to the animal crossing formula and they stayed in their comfort zone  very lazy in my opinion and let us not even talk about the horrendous decision that it is only an island per console  not per session  per console omg  even pokemon that receive so much hate it deigned to break its stigma and let a cartridge can have multiple savedatas on the same switch  very greedy decision by nintendo disappointing game that does not meet the high expectations we had of an animal crossing for console traducción de la misma manera como los detractores intentaron difamar y destruir pokémon hace 4 meses con criterios vacíos  hipocresía y caprichos personales de manera injusta  lo mismo haré con este juego para ser un título de switch no creo que haya dado el salto de calidad que todos esperábamos  gráficamente se ve limitado  por alguna razón la geografía del mundo sigue siendo cilíndrica y no existe cámara libre en el overworld  cuando esto antes era justificable por cuestiones técnicas  en switch no tiene sentido que el juego se vea tan simple animal crossing sigue teniendo la misma fórmula de hace 18 años  su última iteración solo agrega cambios superficiales pero sigue siendo lo mismo  lo cual aburre algunas mecánicas se han reemplazado por otras y eso me molesta  y el sistema de progresión es bastante torpe y mal diseñado este debería ser el breath of the wild de animal crossing pero el mapa sigue siendo igual de limitado como siempre lo ha sido  el animal crossing ideal debería ser un open word pero en eso nos han decepcionado casi no hay verdadera evolución gráfica y se ve como un juego de 3ds en hd  lo cual es patético y desaprovechado tenían la oportunidad de darle una vuelta de 180 grados a la fórmula de animal crossing y se quedaron en su zona de confort  bastante perezoso en mi opinión y ya ni hablemos de la pesima decision de que solo es una isla por consola  que no por sesion  por consola es que por dios  incluso pokémon que tanto lo odian se digno a romper su estigma y dejar que un cartucho puede tener múltiples partidas en una misma switch  decisión muy avara por parte de nintendo juego decepcionante que no cumple con las grandes expectativas que teníamos de un animal crossing para consola  expand
31,an awesome animal crossing experience  being able to build out your island the way you like is an awesome feature  it is almost like having a crossover episode between minecraft and animal crossing the only negative is nothe one island per console  if we could have even one per user i would have given this game a higher score 
32,as a first timer to the animal crossing series  it was a bit hard to get into at first  but i really enjoy it now  the music  the graphics  the vibe  it is all so relaxing  the only downside i cannothink of now is nothe crazy amount of dialogue you cannot skip  great game  cannot wait to play in other seasons 
33,would be a perfect 10 if it were not for the unnecessarily clunky couch co op  especially considering how well the first animal crossing implemented it  you have a primary player who can play the game as normal and a secondary player who can  sit there and look pretty  they can pick up items  albeit islowly with an annoying animation playing each time and items are sent to the recycle binwould be a perfect 10 if it were not for the unnecessarily clunky couch co op  especially considering how well the first animal crossing implemented it  you have a primary player who can play the game as normal and a secondary player who can  sit there and look pretty  they can pick up items  albeit islowly with an annoying animation playing each time and items are sent to the recycle bin instead of your inventory  you can fish and catch bugs  but only as long as they re on the same screen as the primary player  they are often much more spread out so there is only one at a time on the screen the only saving grace is nothe fact that you can switch who the primary is by simply shaking the controllers  otherwise this installment of animal crossing is vastly improved from the previous games  with better visuals  customisation and more quality of life improvements than i can count  in older animal crossing games i only found a couple hours of things to do per day  in new horizons there iseems to be a plethora of activities to take part in with new activities opening up the more i play  the new ability to terraform the landscape and really shape the island to my liking is a more than welcome addition and makes me feel like i am really starting a little town of my very own  if you are playing on your own  you will not be able to find a better animal crossing experience  if you are buying this noto play with a friend  however  just keep the limitations of couch co op in mind before you buy  nintendo should have been more transparent about this clunky co op pre launch but i know exactly why they were not  and tom nook would have done the same thing  expand
34,it is a very slow start  a few real time days  but once you get past that barrier the world opens up massively  it is a peaceful game to hop into whenever you feel like it  and rewards those that play long hours  or even 1 or 2 at a time  highly recommended to those looking for an escape  and if you truly want to customize your character  get the pro editor in the nook miles store
35,this is my first animal crossing game i have ever played  i am seriously addicted to this game i cannot stop playing  maybe the best nintendo game yet
36,i like it iso far  unfair to rate the game a 0 because of a poor design choice on co op 
37,this game is absolutely amazing as a constant side game for one s day  it a great game to relax with 
38,probably the best animal crossing has ever been  and to fans of the series it does enough to update the core gameplay loop to keep it fresh and interesting the negative reviews all seem to be people who have never played animal crossing before  the one island setup is intentional and has been a thing forever 
39,an amazing game and the best ac yet  if you wouldo not understand there is only one town per system sorry you wouldo not get ac 
40,an absolutely awesome addition to the franchise  everything about this game has been tailor made for longtime fans of the series  there is a ridiculous amount of quality of life upgrades to the game  any fan of the series will adore the game

42,there are no words to describe the flawlessly  gorgeous graphics and detail that have gone into creating this game  as an animal crossing fan that has played every game since gamecube  i am utterly amazed at how far the series has come  does it have a little bit different feel  yes but that does not make it any less enjoyable than any of the other games i have played in the series  i havethere are no words to describe the flawlessly  gorgeous graphics and detail that have gone into creating this game  as an animal crossing fan that has played every game since gamecube  i am utterly amazed at how far the series has come  does it have a little bit different feel  yes but that does not make it any less enjoyable than any of the other games i have played in the series  i have read all other people s reviews and the people giving it a bad review either new absolutely nothing about the series or did absolutely zero research before purchasing the game  i would give this game a solid 10 10 but i have to give it a 9 just because the game seems to start out more slowly than any of the others in the series and parts of the game feel a little more like work and more tedious than previous games  i would have liked the game to have started out with at least 3 villagers instead of 2 but all these things are very little complaints  overall  the game is great and i look forward to playing it every day for the next several years to come  expand
43,i absolutely love this game  however  both me and my brother would like to have our own islands but this is not possible without the purchase of another switch  this is extremely disappointing as nintendo intentionally did this  they could have just done the save files similar to games like botw or smo  but they did not  so  despite this being one of my favorite games this year  i feeli absolutely love this game  however  both me and my brother would like to have our own islands but this is not possible without the purchase of another switch  this is extremely disappointing as nintendo intentionally did this  they could have just done the save files similar to games like botw or smo  but they did not  so  despite this being one of my favorite games this year  i feel nintendo made a poor decision in forcing players to buy multiple switches to have multiple islands  expand
44,best ac game ever  it combines all i have loved of previous games and added new features that makes this game so much enjoyable 
45,this is easily without a doubt the best game in the series  it adds so many small features and the music is super chill 
46,excelente game  divertido em todos os aspectos  um prato cheio para fãs da franquia 
47,exactly what i expected from an animal crossing game  great atmosphere and gameplay  the controls are intuitive and the game just works 
48,an amazing game  that will make you forget there is something like a real world out there  excelled in the good things new leaf got right  and made an even better transition from handheld to console  10 10
49,the looks  the feel  and the improvements from the other games are amazing 
50,a fantastic little game that will eat up your spare time  whether it be decorating your home  growing and tending your garden  socialising  adventuring  shopping  teraforming the landscape  crafting or interacting with the wildlife  animal crossing has something for everyone the game works in real time so times of days  seasons  deliveries  and events change depending on what s happeninga fantastic little game that will eat up your spare time  whether it be decorating your home  growing and tending your garden  socialising  adventuring  shopping  teraforming the landscape  crafting or interacting with the wildlife  animal crossing has something for everyone the game works in real time so times of days  seasons  deliveries  and events change depending on what s happening in the real world  this creates a slower paced game and allows you as a player to take your time and let your little island grow organically with every decision you make  there are some complaining about island sharing with others on the same console but the fact is it makes the game better  islands are sizable so there is plenty of space for everyone but most importantly this is a social game and multiple residents makes it easier to harvest and share resources which is essential to progression  all in all a wonderful game and highly recommended  expand
51,this is just my happy place game along with breath of the wild and fire emblem three houses  all relaxing and chill  nothing about it feels unfinished or not fun  everything feels like it belongs in animal crossing and easily took over my life in the last few hours  and i know it will not wear off
52,best game of my life  this game is nothe best i have ever seen  perfect graphics  perfect gameplay  everything is perfect  but if you see some negative reviews is why they did not feel the classic game that was your friend play and advance some parts and that s a good and nostalgic thing  so my grade is 10 10

57,animal crossing new horizons is an absolute masterpiece and by far the best game in the series 
58,animal crossing  new horizons is a significant improvement over the tragically bad amiibo festival as it  goes back to the classic gameplay that we know from our childhoods 
59,animal crossing  new horizons was one of the best first party games exclusively published by nintendo  packed with new and interesting content  it is something worthwhile for individuals looking forward playing the next series of animal crossing  recently  they showcased so much information on animal crossing direct  and there were exciting things we can do  for instance  the ability ofanimal crossing  new horizons was one of the best first party games exclusively published by nintendo  packed with new and interesting content  it is something worthwhile for individuals looking forward playing the next series of animal crossing  recently  they showcased so much information on animal crossing direct  and there were exciting things we can do  for instance  the ability of being able to terraform and waterscape the land  achievements  8 players online  customizations  and so on  while playing it  one of the honorable mentions was the writing itself  which may be referred to as the character s dialog  because they were willing to add variety of words when they talk  it iseems enjoyable and natural to go talk with different characters in the game  however  there are downsides  you might have only one island per console  which means you cannot have multiple islands in the game  besides  the incapable of not supporting cloud saves  it needs to be supported  so people will not get their internal data lost  although  the game fully meets expectations with a good gameplay in which it is intended for hardcore audiences  at last  this is beyond the next level of animal crossing game  and a must buy title in 2020  expand
60,best animal crossing game  beautiful and fresh game  you want to spend more time in the world you create with likable characters and lots of things to do  minecraft of switch era  so much creativity  loving it iso far
61,this game dragged me too much  i cannot live without it   help me please 
62,countless hours of fun awaits you in this fabulous game  it has lots of new stuff and new mechanics that will keep you playing all day and night  but the effort is rewarded  you never get bored when you wouldo all of the features like fishing  crafting  completing challenges  etc 100  recommeded and truly a must play if you have a switch 
63,by far the best animal crossing game yet  sure  one island per system is oldscool  it was there in every animal crossing game  but it ishould encourages beeing social and sharing one island with your family 
64,best animal crossing game hands down  graphics are gorgeous and gameplay is addicting as always  the moment i was able to pick objects up  i spent an hour picking up weeds xd  so many trolls talking about a horrible co op experience  more than likely mislead because they do not research a game before they buy it  they just buy into the hype  this game lives up to the hype for this long timebest animal crossing game hands down  graphics are gorgeous and gameplay is addicting as always  the moment i was able to pick objects up  i spent an hour picking up weeds xd  so many trolls talking about a horrible co op experience  more than likely mislead because they do not research a game before they buy it  they just buy into the hype  this game lives up to the hype for this long time animal crossing fan  the co op experience reminds me of the good ol  ds days  i have not gotten too far into it yet  but i am already addicted and see myself coming back to the island every day  even if it is for a short amount of time  also  i am the only person on my console playing this game  and i wouldo not time skip because i am a patient person along for the experience  thank you nintendo  sorry people are review bombing your game because they clearly did not watch all of the videos you put forth in preparation for the game update 4 4 2020  this game has officially consumed my life  with the coronavirus bs going on and everything closing  this allows me to hang out with friends and family  it iscratches the itch for social interaction  and i literally cannot stop playing this  soooo much customization  you can literally recreate your entire island  this game deserves a much better user score than what it has   i would say at the lowest an 8 5  expand
65,an overall enjoyable and relaxing game  it is basically an expansion of new leaf mayor system which i enjoyed very much  so it cool to see a whole game around that 
66,its a great game especially to play during the pandemic  im really enjoying it  stay positive and be safe out their 
67,people obviously dont understand the crossing if they think couch coop is a thing and you wouldont need multiple switches  amazing experience  best in class  best crossing game yet  live love love 
68,people  stop freaking out about the whole 1 town  1 switch thing  honestly  you probably have two switches  switch lites if you areally want to play with anyone in your family  everyone is just looking at the game s one multiplayer flaw and immediately giving it a zero  no one is looking at the game by itself  and i see a extremely polished animal crossing game that me and my brother arepeople  stop freaking out about the whole 1 town  1 switch thing  honestly  you probably have two switches  switch lites if you areally want to play with anyone in your family  everyone is just looking at the game s one multiplayer flaw and immediately giving it a zero  no one is looking at the game by itself  and i see a extremely polished animal crossing game that me and my brother are having a blast with  there are some quality of life issues  for example selling stuff does not let you select multiple items to sell at a time  same with buying  but those can be easily overlooked  it is probably one of the best looking switch games  and the music is phenomenal  definitely a game you can really sink your teeth in until nintendo eventually gives us another great game to play  i have not gotten to try out the online yet  but it does look really fun going to your friends islands and helping them too  hopefully this has convinced you to get this game  and do not listen to the whinerscomplaining about one problem who do not see the game for what it truly is  expand

70,that s a fantastic game  the beat animal crossing since the first hours player i cannot ask something better
71,as this was my first animal crossing  i had my hopes high  perhaps even higher than reasonable  but thankfully  months of hype and a pre order did not go to waste  as this is already one of my favorite switch games  thanks  nintendo  for another great game 
72,after some hours of playing i can say my opinion its a good game its really relaxing and with this game you cannotake a break this game is really good in this period because of the quarantine the bad thing is nothat at the very first hours you cannot explore that much because of the 2 rivers  also this game is not for everyone not everyone can appreciate this game but anyway its a really goodafter some hours of playing i can say my opinion its a good game its really relaxing and with this game you cannotake a break this game is really good in this period because of the quarantine the bad thing is nothat at the very first hours you cannot explore that much because of the 2 rivers  also this game is not for everyone not everyone can appreciate this game but anyway its a really good game it has some really good graphics and i wouldid not see any graphic problem so yeah i reccomend this p s this game is is even better with headphones relaxing music high quality sound effects is nothe best you should try if you have some headphones  expand
73,this game is already a 20 10 just playing less than 5 hours  it is already blown new leaf out of the waters 
74,as a vetern new leaf player  i really enjoy this recent release  its really relaxing and fun to play each day  this notype of game isn t for binging in one sitting  it takes time to fully play it defo recommend it for any switch owner 
75,a brand new animal crossing experience  and a fresh one  the in game content seems endless  while the typical atmosphere of the franchise is fully present nothing to say  awesome
76,this game is perfect after a hard day of work to relax and have a good time you can play it 10 min a day or 4 hours a day   its a lot what you can do when you like nl you also will love nh 
77,this is nothe second best looking game on the switch in terms of art style and graphics and the game play is just like good old classic ac and i love the new mile system to keep doing daily activities in game i hope the future updates keep the game going for years 
78,from my first 4 hours of playing  i cannotell this game is an absolute master class in creativity   i wouldo not normally enjoy games like this but there is just something about the charm and progression system that fills me with joy  if you are on the fence and want a completely lax  joy filled experience  then i cannot recommend this game enough 
79,i have not played animal crossing since wild world on ds  this game is hd and a great step up  i have enjoyed every aspect of the game  this game is nothe best animal crossing game to date  people who are review bombing because they cannot have seperate islands per switch are just being childish  the game wants to create that social experience and that decision is a creative one  i personallyi have not played animal crossing since wild world on ds  this game is hd and a great step up  i have enjoyed every aspect of the game  this game is nothe best animal crossing game to date  people who are review bombing because they cannot have seperate islands per switch are just being childish  the game wants to create that social experience and that decision is a creative one  i personally and glad that it is limited one island per switch  get the game  you will not regret it  expand
80,people are over reacting amazing single player meh multiplayer simple nintendo has meh multiplayer
81,wonderful game  my first animal crossing  nintedo switch graphics are stunning  a lot like stardew valley  but more nook  however  please let me pick up multiple items at once 
82,unique concept  pacing and vibe  a true open world game where you wouldictate the pace and even the plot  one of the all time great games 
83,imagine rating it one star simply because you wouldo not like one design choice  as if all of the good was completely wiped out simply because you can only have one island it isucks that that s the case  but at the same time the game is fantastic  i amean  it is the best animal crossing experience so far  you will love it 
84,carismático  relaxante  e com um esmero absoluto um carinho absurdo da nintendo nesta obra obrigatório 
85,made a metacritic account just to give this game a 10 10today is nothe day my animal crossing addiction began 
86,great game  beautiful graphics  lots of heart and soul was put into this game  i have already spend hours just fishing that s how good it is  it is a good game for new and old fans 
87,ive seen a lot of these reviews saying  why is nothere only one island per switch  this was told to us way before the release  another thing  anyone reading this debating whether or not to get it  please take the editors review more serious than these ones  as theres a group of facebook switch members downrating the game on purpose  because they want another game to be higher rated  
88,super fun  would recommend to any animal crossing fan  the island progression is really fun to go through and the book miles tasks are really engaging 
89,best animal crossing game  just everything i wanted for so so long  as a big animal crossing fan i am giving this nothe yes cannot wait to experience so much more 
90,best animal crossing game of all time  this is so beautiful  so comfy  yeap goty 
91,best animal crossing game to datei understand that it is only one island per console but nintendo might change that very soon as the production team of animal crossing are very passionate towards their games
92,i love animal crossing and this is nothe best titleeverything is beautiful  everything is improved  and every animal crossing fan needs to play just say that for people who are saying that nintendo did not warn about being an island by nintendo switch  it is a lie  everything was warned  we even had a nintendo direct of animal crossing talking about everything in the game 
93,the long awaited hype for the sequel to animal crossing new leaf has been met the short delay was well worth it and i am happy nintendo took their time 
94,animal crossing was hardly ever a staunch local co op game  the people who are rating this game  zero  for it only allowing one island are missing the point entirely  it is a feature intended for investments of familiarity  people expect every game these days to have every feature they have wanted from every game  the game excels on making your island feel like your slice of paradise awayanimal crossing was hardly ever a staunch local co op game  the people who are rating this game  zero  for it only allowing one island are missing the point entirely  it is a feature intended for investments of familiarity  people expect every game these days to have every feature they have wanted from every game  the game excels on making your island feel like your slice of paradise away from home  to dilute the game with multiple journeys defeats the point  your visitors are treated as such because it is your town anyway  this is nothe animal crossing game to get stuck into  it is a masterful work of comfort and relaxation  should you be a fan of magical simulation games  this is an obvious buy  expand
95,очень хорошая игра  мне очень понравилась стилистика этой игры
96,невероятная игра с уникальной атмосферой  точнее то нужно для релакса в 2020 не понимаю тех  кто ставит это милой игре 0 баллов  у вас нет чувств 
97,vários jogos do switch só podem ter um save  eu não sei pra que reclamar tanto
98,it is a fun game  very reminiscent of the old animal crossing games  however  the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn t cool  in fact  only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from tom nook and other characters  not even a second copy of the game will rectify this  the only way to rectify it is noto buy another switch  nintendo is beingit is a fun game  very reminiscent of the old animal crossing games  however  the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn t cool  in fact  only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from tom nook and other characters  not even a second copy of the game will rectify this  the only way to rectify it is noto buy another switch  nintendo is being very greedy in limiting the game play like this  and for that reason  i give this game a 4  expand
99,yes  the game starts slowly  but by day 3  i have had so much to do  i wouldo not know what to do with all my time   this is exactly the game the world needs right now   highly recommended  10 10 
100,the game is probably fine but you cannot fully experience it if you are the second player on the same console  you are forced to live on the island of the player who first started the game  even worse  you share resources  so player one collects all fruits  insects etc  and you stand there with nothing  this has to be the worst game design decision ever made  until that is fixed i cannotthe game is probably fine but you cannot fully experience it if you are the second player on the same console  you are forced to live on the island of the player who first started the game  even worse  you share resources  so player one collects all fruits  insects etc  and you stand there with nothing  this has to be the worst game design decision ever made  until that is fixed i cannot play and therefore not recommend the game  shame on you nintendo  thats not family friendly at all  expand
101,perfect for one player  coop sucks  but what kills the game is nothat you can essentially only have one player per switch  your so sibling kid will have to play on your island on your profile i cannot think of a single other home console game with this limitation  not being able to share this with my family makes it a return 
102,this game is just further proof that nintendo refuses to understand what people want from an online experience  only one island  combined with whoever leads gets all the items picked up  bottom line is if your not leading your not progressing 
103,i like many people and  across several platforms  share my switch with my partner  practically  locking the game to one user per console is absolutely disgusting  that s all ther is noto say 
104,i ll update my review as i play  but mannnn this game is boring 2 hours into the game and i got a house  that s all i feel like i accomplished  games are supposed to bring some short of enjoyment  whether it be story  graphics or gameplay  this has none of that so far  just kill me now please 
105,the game is almost perfect  i amust say that the only flaw is really the fact that you can only have one island   many review bomb confirm that  but other thant that  the game is perfect  cannot wait to put 100 more hours in it 
106,so far of what i played  i wouldo not think it deserves all the hate it gets  however some of the problems especially early on can be a huge dealbreaker to some such as 1 island per user  co op  and the fact that it istarts off super slowly  which could turn off new fans  also why do you get hourly music later in the game  hearing the same track for the whole day gets really irritating  also iso far of what i played  i wouldo not think it deserves all the hate it gets  however some of the problems especially early on can be a huge dealbreaker to some such as 1 island per user  co op  and the fact that it istarts off super slowly  which could turn off new fans  also why do you get hourly music later in the game  hearing the same track for the whole day gets really irritating  also i wouldo not really like the piece of music  but that is a me problem  hopefully nintendo listens and fixes some of these issues  overall  i highly recommend this game  gorgeous graphics  fun and addicting gameplay  and the amazing charm the series is best known for  expand
107,this is a masterpiece of a life simulation getaway  my only gripe with this game is how it very restrictive with the multiplayer with friends and family  but for me  this is a game that i amostly play by myself  and it is honestly the definitive animal crossing fixing alot of the issues from other titles and expanded upon the mechanics that they established  i love this game 
108,early play review  the first 8 hours are great   we have 2 players on our system and in my opinion as long as you have the primary player set up the island it works great   my wife has about 8 hours in the game  i have about 6 sharing an island thoughts so far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an island   i should qualify the review by stating that iearly play review  the first 8 hours are great   we have 2 players on our system and in my opinion as long as you have the primary player set up the island it works great   my wife has about 8 hours in the game  i have about 6 sharing an island thoughts so far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an island   i should qualify the review by stating that i played the gamecube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3ds version so i have not played all iterations of the game   still  i have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it iso player 2  3 and 4 are not held back i always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing   how one player would teach the computer characters specific words   you and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers   competing to get rare fossils first   to me that was the fun of the game   personally  i think so long as you are not a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space actual game review i love it   to anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression   if you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want   if you have not played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is   professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game   this may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years   animal crossing is a game where you basically hang out on an island with npc s who you chat with and just hang out   they are like virtual friends   they learn your speech and are happy to see you   you gradually develop the island by changing the landscape and adding little customizations all around   these are all small almost mindless tasks but it gives you a felling of touching up your home   you can also visit friends islands which is much easier in the modern age of the internet than it use to be   it is all fun in a passive sort of way   the game is ideally played for around 15 to 30 min a day every day for years   you wouldo a few tasks and watch how the world changes with the seasons and holidays   slowly collecting things and changing the world   i imagine some of the negative reviews are people trying to marathon the game because they are stuck inside due to the virus outbreak   you can play for hours a day but that probably isn t the best way to enjoy things as the game clock is part of what drives progress   if these things sound pleasant and fun you might like it   animal crossing really is an acquired taste but i am happy to say that the format still has life left in it after all these years  expand
109,it is a great game  short of giving it a 10 because the save file stuff is crap 
110,i want to preface this by saying i wouldo enjoy this game when playing single player  the only problem is i play with my wife and anyone who wants to play this game with one or more people will have a horrible time  couch co op in new horizons might be the worst co op i have every played in any video game  anyone who is not player 1 is unable to access their inventory  interact with villagersi want to preface this by saying i wouldo enjoy this game when playing single player  the only problem is i play with my wife and anyone who wants to play this game with one or more people will have a horrible time  couch co op in new horizons might be the worst co op i have every played in any video game  anyone who is not player 1 is unable to access their inventory  interact with villagers or even go into buildings  how can a game have local multiplayer without split iscreen in 2020  it is pathetic and it ishows how low nintendo will go to sell more consoles  if it was not for this nothe game would be rated much higher but this is a definite deal breaker  you wouldun goofed  nintendo  expand
111,i will surely sink lots of time in this game  do not see any problem with the restriction  one console   one island  just buy your wife kid a switch 
112,very upset about this game  loading times too long  i wouldo not like waiting 10 seconds everytime i leave a tent  i hate the noises the characters make when they speak  but the worst part of all  my shared console means only 1 person can play this game  i share a switch with my boyfriend and because of the one island per console bull crap we basically cannot both play it without one personvery upset about this game  loading times too long  i wouldo not like waiting 10 seconds everytime i leave a tent  i hate the noises the characters make when they speak  but the worst part of all  my shared console means only 1 person can play this game  i share a switch with my boyfriend and because of the one island per console bull crap we basically cannot both play it without one person having severely lacking boring and depressing game play  so i have let him have it  i am very upset that a 60 dollar game only allows one save and not allowing separate games for separate profiles  will never buy another animal crossing  this was my first animal crossing ever and i am glad i never bought any of the previous  they do not deserve my money  expand
113,game getting review bombed over nitpicks and small inconveniences  sounds about metacritic 
114,it is beautiful  is definitely more than i was expecting i cannot wait for the upcoming events 
115,having a total blast so far  all the animals are adorable and the music is soft and calming  my friend visited my town and we played instruments together for like 10 minutes  this was definately the kind of sit back and relax kind of game it was hyped up to be 
116,animal crossing is an absolutely perfect game in all areas  i beg you  dear reader  ignore the entitled nature of the negative reviews  the decision to limit players to a single island has been made for artistic purposes and was very well communicated to the playerbase before they could have made their purchase  at the end of the day the nintendo switch and nintendo switch lite consolesanimal crossing is an absolutely perfect game in all areas  i beg you  dear reader  ignore the entitled nature of the negative reviews  the decision to limit players to a single island has been made for artistic purposes and was very well communicated to the playerbase before they could have made their purchase  at the end of the day the nintendo switch and nintendo switch lite consoles are portable devices that most of the time support only one player  expecting anything else is straight entitlement in the graphical department animal crossing  new horizons is astonishingly amazing  it is gorgeous to look at  the gameplay is fantastic and a lot of fun  this is exactly the game needed to let go and relax during these hard times  expand
117,i love the animal crossing series  and acnh is a perfect addition  countless islands to explore and everything looks great  lots to do and it is so relaxing just chilling on your personal island  definitely pick this one up if you enjoy relaxation and fun 
118,this is 100  the best ac experience so far ignore the 0s given by stupid people out here  the game is amazing
119,by far one of the most charming games of 2020  the game offers a variety of tasks and adventure to explore with its new deserted island theme  the diy crafting mechanic allows you to build new items instead of buying them like in past game and offers new uses for existing material on your island  the characters are charming and have unique personalities that keep the game refreshing 
120,this is a personal experience  relaxing game  although the pace is a little too slow sometimes 
121,absolutely loving the game so far  i love how it is equal amounts of hand holding and letting you wouldo whatever you want  cannot wait to play this for many years like the previous games  but nintendo really needs to add more than one island per switch 
122,mucho mejor que new leaf  es genial como te mantienen ocupado con los tickets  en verdad hay gente que se queja por que debe pasar dias reales para hacer cosas   acaso solo compraron el juego por el mame 
123,я не знаю как  но эта игра меня не отпускает совсем 
124,new horizons is charming  has great music  and brings new ideas to the series without messing with the animal crossing identity 
125,i honestly think that this is one of the best games i have ever played  there is so much attention to detail with this  i hope that they continue to update everything as time goes on to add even more content my only issues with the game so far are  it is slow to start so do everything you can and then skip your clock forward until you have the full museum and the store  the cut scenesi honestly think that this is one of the best games i have ever played  there is so much attention to detail with this  i hope that they continue to update everything as time goes on to add even more content my only issues with the game so far are  it is slow to start so do everything you can and then skip your clock forward until you have the full museum and the store  the cut scenes when people join and leave your island are annoying after a while and are far too long  the island tours need to provide more of a benefit because if you have enough friends  you likely will have all of the fruit anyway  expand
126,this game is pretty good   it is good to see animal crossing back at it is feet  after that one garbage game on the wii u  the games charming  funny sometimes  and just everything animal crossing 
127,it is been said 100 times already but one island per switch is straight trash  the gamecube version did better than this  how can you take such a big step back cheating the core of your fanbase  young families who grew up with this game   now have partners  kids  i wouldo not understand this  even looking at the business side  no one is going to buy this  if they have anyone else in houseit is been said 100 times already but one island per switch is straight trash  the gamecube version did better than this  how can you take such a big step back cheating the core of your fanbase  young families who grew up with this game   now have partners  kids  i wouldo not understand this  even looking at the business side  no one is going to buy this  if they have anyone else in house that wants to play  co op is garbage as well  expand

131,great game great fun  its colourful and chill i like it a lot  perfect for 31 years old guy  me 
132,animal crossing new horizons is an amazing game by all accounts  the graphical presentation is superb  so the gameplay  now it is absolutely impossible to rate an animal crossing game based on only 2 3 days of play 
133,wonderful game to just sit down and relax with  beautiful visuals and a great aoundtrack 
134,why one island per switch  that s so stupid and that does not work for families who share a switch  that s awful
135,amazing game  perfectly crafted for an extremely enjoyable and relaxing single player experience  it is been 7 years since a mainline animal crossing  and this perfectly revives the series from its grave of spin offs  if people are complaining about a single island per console  or a stripped down version of other family members villagers  the game has normally had a lesser experience foramazing game  perfectly crafted for an extremely enjoyable and relaxing single player experience  it is been 7 years since a mainline animal crossing  and this perfectly revives the series from its grave of spin offs  if people are complaining about a single island per console  or a stripped down version of other family members villagers  the game has normally had a lesser experience for new villagers  because they did not found the island  about the single island  it was announced long before and is disappointing  but does not break and ruin the game the graphics are lovely  and every little detail is crafted for a long running fan of the series  like a love letter to us  by far the best animal crossing of all time  expand

140,dont listen to any of the 0 10 s those guys have no idea how scoring games works  i havent played the game but im just here to help the other people who wanna see if the game is good or not  the game is definitely a great game that is a must buy  it is fantastic  but you can only have one island per console  but keep in mind it was like this for new leaf as well and me and my sister weredont listen to any of the 0 10 s those guys have no idea how scoring games works  i havent played the game but im just here to help the other people who wanna see if the game is good or not  the game is definitely a great game that is a must buy  it is fantastic  but you can only have one island per console  but keep in mind it was like this for new leaf as well and me and my sister were able to enjoy this game completely fine on one 3ds console  the way this game works is no different  people are only mad that the other people that wanna play would have a downgraded experience since they cant change much in the village  while i wouldo agree that they should ve fixed this since the switch unlike the 3ds  is capable of having multiple accounts  while on the 3ds there are no accounts  it is only one game and one save file and when you start playing you choose your villager  it was a missed opportunity  i wish they wouldve made it iso on the switch  each account has its own village and if people want to share a village they make their own villager in that account and if they want their own village they go in another account  but its definitely something ive experienced before  but back then a 3ds was pretty much the same price as a switch lite now  so if you want them to have their own console and their own village just get them a switch lite  people probably did that with the 3ds so why not with the switch  when i played on the 3ds i was the mayor and my sister was a villager and she enjoyed the game almost as much as i wouldid  so the people with 0 10 are outright dumb cause one flaw in a game shouldnt change it from a 10 10 to a 0 10 that just makes no sense  besides  if youre forever alone or if youre the only one in your house that wants to play the game  it would most likely be a 10 10 for you  so if you like animal crossing games or stardew valley  this is a must buy  expand
141,only 1 island per switch  come on  if someone else in your home wants to play this game they are restricted to the island of the first account to play  so that destroy the experience to the second player 
142,this is nothe evolution of ninendo making you buy two copies of pokemon  if this does not get fixed i am ready for a class action lawsuit
143,do not get if you plan on using the switch as it was intended  aka a portable console you can use while you travel  because surprise surprise nintendo is so overbearing that holidays will be released as updates that you need internet to install and to play  good job nintendo  you areally got those evil time travelers that were seriously cutting into your bank  oh wait  time traveling affectsdo not get if you plan on using the switch as it was intended  aka a portable console you can use while you travel  because surprise surprise nintendo is so overbearing that holidays will be released as updates that you need internet to install and to play  good job nintendo  you areally got those evil time travelers that were seriously cutting into your bank  oh wait  time traveling affects no one but the player who might otherwise not be able to play due to travel work school game feels unfinished  hundreds of items cut  many characters cut  so no point to the amiibo features to get your fave villagers unless you are lucky  swimming gyroids paintings 99  of special npcs cut  everywhere you look theres cut content that we get to hopefully wait for nintendo to drip feed us while a chorus of people repeat that hey  this next update in a week a month a year might be the one that gives us a few more basic features  maybe you should just stop complaining since now theres so many new things like oh wait  the furniture placement stuff is from hhd  and crafting furniture from harvested material to place outside is from pocket camp so  nothing new except this stick i can use to cross rivers i guess 2 points for unfinished game at launch   2 cut content over all     3 for nintendos controlling attitude   fans acting like just because they personally did not love a feature got lucky the things they liked are in game means the cuts dont matter  3 remaining are for graphics  which are a vast improvement from other installments  expand
144,it is great  nothing else to say more to describe the game  you always have something to do  you always can relax at the beach listening to the game s beautiful ost  great  it indeed is a must play 
145,nintendo lo ha vuelto a hacer  animal crossing new horizons es de lo mejor que puedes encontrar en switch 
146,great game  slowly teaches you what to do and makes it more fun then a chore 
147,amazing game as a singleplayer experience  the couch coop leaves a lot to be desired  but this is an addition that nintendo never needed to add that being said  this does not warrant the countless 0 10 reviews people are throwing around  another failing part of the rating system that is metacritic 
148,the one island per switch is way of an issue than i would thought it would be  others not being able to progress since i have not played it enough makes it less fun for both them and me 
149,what s wrong with people here  all this outrage for the 1 switch   1 island is nonsense  first of all nintendo was very clear about this so people acting surprised about it have only themself to blame  but also every single animal crossing before was like this  so how is possible the best one of the series is nothe one getting bombed  ridiculous  if you are the secondary player you still getwhat s wrong with people here  all this outrage for the 1 switch   1 island is nonsense  first of all nintendo was very clear about this so people acting surprised about it have only themself to blame  but also every single animal crossing before was like this  so how is possible the best one of the series is nothe one getting bombed  ridiculous  if you are the secondary player you still get like 90  of the experience and you are supposed to talk with your family and organize yourselves to make the important choices and share the resources  how is nothis so hard  and how is people judging the gameplay experience so negatively after just 1 2 days of gameplay  this game is not designed to be fully enjoyed on a couple of days  grow up  the game is fantastic so far  expand
150,this game is amazing i am a fan of animal crossing serise when i heard new animal crossing in switch  i am worried because previous game is very good however  this game is really good must play 
151,the critics on animal crossing new horizons are i find that people are just not happy because there is only one island for me it is not a problem i but 9 because it just a little bug on my part but otherwise the game is awesome 
152,10 10 si juegas te enganchas como nunca a otro juego  mejorando ac new leaf
153,unfortunately i have to rate this game twice lower  for a single player this is game is nice but it is totally not recommended for a household with one console  you can only have one island per switch and only the first user to start the game   the founder   gets full experience  the rest can get no quests  no proper interactions with npcs and are limited in many other ways  such as theunfortunately i have to rate this game twice lower  for a single player this is game is nice but it is totally not recommended for a household with one console  you can only have one island per switch and only the first user to start the game   the founder   gets full experience  the rest can get no quests  no proper interactions with npcs and are limited in many other ways  such as the progress of the founder  you also have to share all the resources  i wouldo not see anything relaxing or social in this  only disappointment i hope nintendo will fix this and do it asap  it is totally inappropriate and inhuman to make people buy an extra console and i think no one in the right mind is going to do so  expand
154,it is a solid 7 10 cute little game for killing time on a chill island  but only one person per console gets to fully experience the game   it is designed to push you to buy a second switch 
155,this is a great entry for the animal crossing franchise  the single player experience is just fantastic  i cannot wait to see what other players will do with their islands  i am loving it  it is fun  quirky and most of all very relaxing  to answer all the criticism coming from those who gave the game zero as a score  true  the one island per console is a very weird choice but it was saidthis is a great entry for the animal crossing franchise  the single player experience is just fantastic  i cannot wait to see what other players will do with their islands  i am loving it  it is fun  quirky and most of all very relaxing  to answer all the criticism coming from those who gave the game zero as a score  true  the one island per console is a very weird choice but it was said soooo many times and it is written on the box as well  read a review  a faq  watch a video on youtube before you buy  you have no one else to blame but yourself if you bought something without gathering the  readily available  and necessary information  expand
156,for those saying we do not understand animal crossing was always 1 island  that is not the point  i fully support the idea of having 1 island  the point is nothat player 2 is extremely limited  i cannot even get an axe as player 2  and cannot progress without player 1 finishing everything  player 2 cannot craft certain items  cannot build  cannot make decisions  need i say more  all i am doing asfor those saying we do not understand animal crossing was always 1 island  that is not the point  i fully support the idea of having 1 island  the point is nothat player 2 is extremely limited  i cannot even get an axe as player 2  and cannot progress without player 1 finishing everything  player 2 cannot craft certain items  cannot build  cannot make decisions  need i say more  all i am doing as player 2 is paying off my debt to tom nook  do not know if nintendo did this on purpose to buy another console  or if they actually dropped the ball on this one only buy this game if you play alone  or plan on buying multiple consoles and games  expand
157,pretty fun game  relaxing  adorable  and simple  i wouldont see why people are coming in a review bombing it with 0 s metacritic should do somthing about this because its really becoming a problem 
158,if you are planning to play with more than one person the second player is really more of an afterthought  they get their own house and items but they cannot progress the story and actually miss out on some of the interactions  the game seems really fun but it is incredibly greedy to not allow both players to have a full experience without owning additional switches 
159,leaving it at 0 until nintendo fixes their 60 dollar game  this game is no fun if your a second profile onto the game  the 1st to log on has more privileges and fun than anyone else in the game
160,il gioco è fantastico  ma se condividete la consolle con qualcun altro diventa terribile  solo il primo giocatore potrà godersi il gioco  tutti gli altri saranno costretti a dipendere da lui  non si può costruire  gli strumenti non si possono sbloccare e tante altre limitazioni assurde  non si capisce perché nintendo non abbia volute dare la possibilità di creare diverse isole su unail gioco è fantastico  ma se condividete la consolle con qualcun altro diventa terribile  solo il primo giocatore potrà godersi il gioco  tutti gli altri saranno costretti a dipendere da lui  non si può costruire  gli strumenti non si possono sbloccare e tante altre limitazioni assurde  non si capisce perché nintendo non abbia volute dare la possibilità di creare diverse isole su una consolle  e attenzione  è inutile comprare più di un gioco  il salvataggio sarà sempre lo stesso  quindi se volete godervi una buona esperienza dovete comprare tante consolle  expand

162,i honestly think this game was incredibly well made and was excited to delve further into it  unfortunately  i live in a household with multiple people and only one switch and the game only allows 1 island per switch console  furthermore the game is designed to give the person who initially creates the island far more agency than players who join afterwards  naming the town  doing initiali honestly think this game was incredibly well made and was excited to delve further into it  unfortunately  i live in a household with multiple people and only one switch and the game only allows 1 island per switch console  furthermore the game is designed to give the person who initially creates the island far more agency than players who join afterwards  naming the town  doing initial town building quests  additionally the game does not account for multiple people being on the island and always generates the same amount of resources per day  meaning anyone that plays after someone else is liable to not find any wood  stone or fruit until the next literal day of the week  all of this combines to make the local multiplayer experience terrible  all other games on the switch allow for different user profiles to create new save files  why is nothis not the case for animal crossing  on gamecube i was able to buy another memory card to create another town  for new horizons i would have to buy a completely new switch and copy of the game to have another island  do not buy this game if you have brothers  sisters  parents  friends  lovers  dogs or grandparents interested in playing it  unless of course you are somehow not affected by the global pandemic and can drop another 500 dollars so you can both play happily  expand
163,incredible game  it is definitely a must buy for anyone who enjoys creativity  relaxation  and just carefree fun  it is definitely slow and low stakes  so if you lack patience and an imagination  go play some looter shooter or something  if you put time and work into this game  it will pay off  and the feeling of accomplishment you have when you end up with a beautiful island is amazing  10 10
164,el juego está bien  pero lo que me molestó bastante es que solo sea una isla por persona  esto limita mucho la cantidad de cosas que podes hacer antes de que se renueve el ciclo 
165,only allowing one island per console is noterrible and nintendo should be ashamed of the state this game is in  storytime  two days before launch  i read about this one island policy and was terrified  i wouldo not have a lot of money  so my girlfriend and i share a switch and do not buy many games  she does not play much  so i was thrilled when animal crossing was announced because it looks likeonly allowing one island per console is noterrible and nintendo should be ashamed of the state this game is in  storytime  two days before launch  i read about this one island policy and was terrified  i wouldo not have a lot of money  so my girlfriend and i share a switch and do not buy many games  she does not play much  so i was thrilled when animal crossing was announced because it looks like her type of game  fast forward to me learning about the island  and i expressed my concerns to her  she said to me that it would be okay and we would just share  to my dismay  sharing is not an option  only the primary player can progress the game  any big progression moments must be done only by the one player  any additional players just have to exist and not partake in progression  that is evil  this is nothe worst thing i have seen from nintendo  i played for two hours and decided to stop and let my girlfriend play  again  i could not believe how terribly the second player is notreated  no new resources spawn for each player  i only played for two hours and it was enough for it to be impossible for her to progress in any capacity  she has now decided she will never play again because she tried to play but was not able to since she hit a complete brick wall after ten minutes  we tried to figure it out on the second day  and ultimately this game is not compatible with multiple players  if you are the only person on the switch  this game is great  if you have anyone else at all who playsthe console  the game does not work  i am giving this a 0 10 because of how disappointed and sad my girlfriend is  games should not bring this much upset to anyone  games are to enjoy  not to make you miserable  nintendo is evil  this game is noterrible  i hope they patch it out but i know they will not  nintendo is just as evil as ea  expand
166,this game feels like it is trying to force homes to buy multiple switches rather than letting separate accounts use one switch to experience separate game play  no other game is set up like this  it also restricts content so rather than letting a person binge play  it encourages you to frequently check in on a regular basis 
167,game is awesome  but nintendo thinks it can convince households to each buy their own switch by hampering local play  super annoying 
168,you are only allowed one island on each console and even you are ok with that only the person who plays and creates the island first can enjoy the full experience  other players that have accounts on the same console are extremely limited to what they can do nintendo has said before that they wanted everyone in a household to have their own switch and it looks like this is one of the manyyou are only allowed one island on each console and even you are ok with that only the person who plays and creates the island first can enjoy the full experience  other players that have accounts on the same console are extremely limited to what they can do nintendo has said before that they wanted everyone in a household to have their own switch and it looks like this is one of the many ways they plan on doing it  all under the guise of to prevent cheating even though the main way people cheat is changing the internal clock on their system and they re already doing it  expand
169,uninspired  unoriginal and any other poor adjective you cannothink of  the game has developed a disgusting cult following that will avidly defend the game even if it came out with trees reminiscent of trees running on the n64  which would probably look better than this game   unlike pokemon sword and shield  this game does not have the same pull that drags you away from your every day life 
170,such a great series  i have been playing since the first one on gamecube  taking what we already love about the series and building on it  this game will be just as good as we all hoped for  no doubt about it  the crafting aspect is very welcome and being able to shape and remodel your island to your will is such a step forward for the series  i have only put around 5 hours on this so far  butsuch a great series  i have been playing since the first one on gamecube  taking what we already love about the series and building on it  this game will be just as good as we all hoped for  no doubt about it  the crafting aspect is very welcome and being able to shape and remodel your island to your will is such a step forward for the series  i have only put around 5 hours on this so far  but i am already in love after spending 5 10 more hours on it today  i can say this is easily the best animal crossing to exist  they really covered everything  and everything is noturned up to eleven  each and every aspect that could have gotten better has gotten better  just look at the museum for instance  it is incredible  expand

173,started the game  played for an hour or so and then came back the next day only to have to start the entire game again  i ll be trading this one in

190,we need equal values and opportunities for all players on the island  my girlfriend is nothe first player  which is great but i wouldo not want to wait for her progress  at the same time  i wouldo not want her to have a a second class player experience if i am the founder  fix this nintendo 
191,this game is a masterpiece  it is a game you should always buy for your switch no matter what  you can never get bored of it  and you can get so much hours off of it easily  there is so much to do in the game  and there is always something to do in it  you can customize the look of your character  your island  your house  and you can get villagers  this is  without a doubt  one of the bestthis game is a masterpiece  it is a game you should always buy for your switch no matter what  you can never get bored of it  and you can get so much hours off of it easily  there is so much to do in the game  and there is always something to do in it  you can customize the look of your character  your island  your house  and you can get villagers  this is  without a doubt  one of the best nintendo switch games so  you may be asking  why does this game have a 7 0 user review  and why so much hate  simple  immature review bombers putting 0 on the damn game because of one   con about it  do not be surprised  they re just mad because they did not do research  wait  did not nintendo tell us about it  and was not it like this for the past ac games  i respect disliking that dumb feature  but do not give this game a 0 just because of that  actually try playing it for a while first  expand
192,i bought this game as soon as it came out since i have always been a fan  i started my own island an character and fully expected my sister  who shares a switch with me  to be able to play her own game too  we find out later that she can not have her own island and that she is extremely limited to what she can do in the game  the whole point to animal crossing is doing stuff in thei bought this game as soon as it came out since i have always been a fan  i started my own island an character and fully expected my sister  who shares a switch with me  to be able to play her own game too  we find out later that she can not have her own island and that she is extremely limited to what she can do in the game  the whole point to animal crossing is doing stuff in the community  what is she going to do  just walk around in a world she cant even dig in  great job nintendo  you made what could have been a perfect game into a dud  expand

194,great game  boring start  but starting from the third day on this ac starts to shine
195,i find it funny that there are those here complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per switch  first of all  help the first person choose your island layout  secondly  two heads are better than one in getting the first stumbling blocks out of the way so you can do whatever you want  my wife and i have our own switches  and only one copy of the game  mine is a day onei find it funny that there are those here complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per switch  first of all  help the first person choose your island layout  secondly  two heads are better than one in getting the first stumbling blocks out of the way so you can do whatever you want  my wife and i have our own switches  and only one copy of the game  mine is a day one purchase switch and hers is nothe new ac nh themed version  we swap our single copy back and forth between our two consoles  once we get a second copy  then we can do standard multiplayer  right now  with the insanity going on outside our doors  this is such a breath of fresh air  it is relaxing and sublime  and takes our minds of what s going on right now  and it has so much eye candy  it is ridiculous  i only drop it one point because we cannot figure out how to trade fruit between our islands  what with us only having one copy of the game  expand

197,this game is probably my favorite game and i have only had it for 2 days   i could not recommend this game enough  please if you have a switch go out and buy this game it is amazing 
198,first off let me say that the 1 island per switch argument is completely invalid  all the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now  population  growing had only one town per memory card  wild world only had one town per cartridge  city folk had only one town per system  and new leaf had only one town per cartridge  out of all thefirst off let me say that the 1 island per switch argument is completely invalid  all the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now  population  growing had only one town per memory card  wild world only had one town per cartridge  city folk had only one town per system  and new leaf had only one town per cartridge  out of all the negative reviews on this site  142 at the time of this review  only about 20 30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game now enough of that this game is honestly a wonder to play  its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors  the graphics and sound are phenomenal  the game play is amazing  the way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling  it is almost like the game hypnotizes you  keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game the only reason i wouldo not rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive  40 seconds to load up the mailbox  however this was on only one occasion and i believe it was an isolated incident  some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot  i am mildly disappointed that they do not let you explore the entirety of the island right away but i actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices  also i wouldo agree that the couch co op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2  do not listen to the 1 island per switch people  imo it isn t really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way  hope this helps  expand
199,why one island  and why not a speaker does not make any things  but i love timmy s paws  and the game is very addictive
200,one island per console is unacceptable  if you share your switch with anyone else  do not buy this 
201,almost every negative review i have seen for this game addresses the shared island problem  and it is causing the user score to plummet  however  in the midst of all the controversy  people seem to forget that this problem does not even affect everyone  and that there is a stellar game past this one issue  i would have rated this game 9 10 for its slow start and lack of camera freedom almost every negative review i have seen for this game addresses the shared island problem  and it is causing the user score to plummet  however  in the midst of all the controversy  people seem to forget that this problem does not even affect everyone  and that there is a stellar game past this one issue  i would have rated this game 9 10 for its slow start and lack of camera freedom  but i am rating it a 10 10 to counterbalance all the reviews that forget to actually review the game and its merit rather than a single one of its flaws  i wouldo not believe that a game so fun  heart warming  charming  and immersive should receive such a low user rating solely because it does not specifically tailor to your needs  i can acknowledge the problem  and sure it really sucks  but it isn t representative of literally everything else about this game  in my mind  this game is a near masterpiece and i cannot wait to continue playing it  if you have multiple people that want to play on the same console  i acknowledge that your experience will be hindered due to nintendo s admittedly greedy policies  however  animal crossing  new horizons as a game  as a social experience  and as a switch title  deserves much more than what the user score would initially lead you to believe my final score  9 10  expand
202,this game is a must a perfect 10 10 and one of nintendo s best system seller franchiseyou must buy and play this game well worth the 60 dollars
203,the best nintendo switch game so far  makes use of all the potential of the console and delivers the most inmersive yet funniest animal crossing game to date  it is all what you can expect from a life simulation game and more 
204,it is amazing  great  good  fantastic  incredible  awesome  brilliant  splendid 
205, no cooking almost no interactions with furniture  ex  you cannot play the guitar or watch tv  they are just there 1 island per switch incredibly bad co op item durabilityeverything is nothere to prolong your game time and sell more swtiches  no depth or mechanics  only shallow visuals if you are not after collecting animals for your island like pokemon  you would be better off no cooking almost no interactions with furniture  ex  you cannot play the guitar or watch tv  they are just there 1 island per switch incredibly bad co op item durabilityeverything is nothere to prolong your game time and sell more swtiches  no depth or mechanics  only shallow visuals if you are not after collecting animals for your island like pokemon  you would be better off playing stardew valley  if this was not a nintendo title critics would rate it 6 10  expand
206,amazing game  gameplay  vibes  all of it  do not listen to the whiners leaving 0 star reviews  well worth the buy   the best ac game yet 
207,unable to create more than 1 island per switch and no option to even move game data to be able to get around this  a complete cash grab to force you to buy another switch and game to be able to enjoy the game to its fullest if multiple people want to play 
208,i usually do not write reviews to fight other people s reviews but this is different if you want to find more useful information you should read other positive reviews  this is more like an answer to all those negative ones this is not like pokémon where they removed content and features to sell it back and increased the base price for the games or something and where i couldi usually do not write reviews to fight other people s reviews but this is different if you want to find more useful information you should read other positive reviews  this is more like an answer to all those negative ones this is not like pokémon where they removed content and features to sell it back and increased the base price for the games or something and where i could understand where people were coming from with their opinions but with animal crossing new horizons people seem to like being angry about something that isn t new at all  having only one island per console is something nintendo has done for all previous animal crossing games in some form ac for gc   only 1 town per memory card ac for ds   only 1 town per game ac for wii   only 1 town per system ac for 3ds   only 1 town per game system ac for switch   only 1 island per system the only difference was the way that each device handled save files  so yes  it isometimes had some benefits to how it handled them but that isn t the point  the point is nothat nintendo always wanted people to play together in one town  it has nothing to do with something like nintendo forcing you to buy more consoles  people  please  use your brain  you also could not move the save file from the wii to an sd card  people never complained about those issues so obviously nintendo did not see the need to change it  so why is it now all of a sudden that surprising to everyone and about the thing that only the founder of the island can make progression  that only applies to the story progression like building the museum etc  after the first week  if you wouldo everything in that pace  everyone can do everything  more or less  i am not that far yet so i cannot guarantee it  i just read it in a review  but nobody else  especially the people complaining  seem to have done some research before complaining about it  since i wouldo not believe that you are that far in the game yet that you can even know that much about the game coop is completely knew to this game and in previous games if other players wanted to have a turn  they had to wait until the other person finished theirs  now you can play together at the same time  yes  i also would have liked to play in split iscreen so that s a negative point i would give  but 0 points for those things is just dumb do not get me wrong  i also would like for people to be able to have their own island if they choose to but the way people are acting here is just stupid  it is not greed  it is not nintendo trying to force us buying more consoles  it is just nintendo asking us to play together on one island  sharing and caring for each other  you can like it or dislike it  i understand going down with your personal score  yes  but going down to 0 is just pure hate from you being angry that devs do not make your perfect game  that s not how reviews work  i know i wouldo the same but backwards that s why you should read the first sentence again  p   expand
209,definitely the most expansive and fun animal crossing entry  all my expectations were surpassed 
210,a bad joke  just one island per switch really playable  if you are a family with one switch  you will be pissedoff  nintendo  shame on you  once again you give a   on happy customers 
211,one island per console  is it a joke  this is an instant 0 10  it is absolutely ridiculous  please do not support the developers  do not buy this game 
212,as everyone else has said  it just ridiculous to only allow one island account per console  clearly a money move  did not think nintendo would stoop to being so disrespectful to their fan base and a beloved game 
213,me and my girlfriend bought this  turns out you can only have one island per console  not even per user  the second user basically cannot do anything  cannot trade  cannot place buildings  cannot even get recipes unless they have been unlocked by the first person who played the game  literally the only work around for this is noto buy another switch  it makes loot boxes look moral  so i haveme and my girlfriend bought this  turns out you can only have one island per console  not even per user  the second user basically cannot do anything  cannot trade  cannot place buildings  cannot even get recipes unless they have been unlocked by the first person who played the game  literally the only work around for this is noto buy another switch  it makes loot boxes look moral  so i have to give it zero because guess what  until my girlfriend is bored of it  i cannot even play it  thanks  nintendo  expand
214,very disappointed with how they are limiting multiplayer  my wife and i are managing to share but this is not going to be good in a household with children  changing my rating as the game is wonderful  but it is so hard not to be upset with how they could employ a few things to fix this 
215,i am sure acnh is amazing for player 1 but player 2 is gimped to all hell and has barely any say in what goes on  there is no way to play 2 islands on one switch and i refuse to buy a second switch to play it 
216,not only is nothe game limited to one island per console  but no player other than the person who started the game first is able to progress the game at all  they cannot contribute resources to building  they do not unlock things naturally as the game progresses  and they have no accomplishments they can achieve many people giving positive reviews argue that it is fine because its alwaysnot only is nothe game limited to one island per console  but no player other than the person who started the game first is able to progress the game at all  they cannot contribute resources to building  they do not unlock things naturally as the game progresses  and they have no accomplishments they can achieve many people giving positive reviews argue that it is fine because its always been this way and that really isn t true  no ac game before this one has limited you to one town per console  if i could buy a second copy of the game and get the option to enjoy it as much as my wife is  then i amight be okay with it  but the only option would be to spend hundreds of dollars and buy a second console  if i could even find one in stock right now  expand
217,just like others have mentioned on how trashtendo wants you to buy more than one system  its sick how greedy and how they have became as a company they are the worst  and people keeps supporting and buying their expensive garbage  whats wrong with you i remember when i never understood how they could get away with selling handheld systems without a charger and i still cant understand howjust like others have mentioned on how trashtendo wants you to buy more than one system  its sick how greedy and how they have became as a company they are the worst  and people keeps supporting and buying their expensive garbage  whats wrong with you i remember when i never understood how they could get away with selling handheld systems without a charger and i still cant understand how that was possible and people were ok with it  also their discounts are the worse their games are so expensive  they sell you a 6years old game for 50 60  in the shop  they think their games are something from heaven  please trashtendo go to hell  expand
218,i was super excited for this game  and then find out it is a single shared island for everyone on the switch  my husband has pretty bad anxiety  and would not touch anything because he was afraid to mess something up  definitely a no from me 
219,as a player 2  nintendo has essentially told me that i cannot ever play properly on the game that i share  in theory  sharing an island works  and many games have succeeded in this  the resources most definitely should be independent per player so that everyone has stuff they can do  the fact that it does not literally makes the game unplayable in large households and families that share aas a player 2  nintendo has essentially told me that i cannot ever play properly on the game that i share  in theory  sharing an island works  and many games have succeeded in this  the resources most definitely should be independent per player so that everyone has stuff they can do  the fact that it does not literally makes the game unplayable in large households and families that share a switch because one player will perform all of the activities  filling their nookmiles  leaving nothing left for anyone else to do  sharing an island at all should be a choice  and the game itself should be designed around sharing  with safeguards allowing every player to fully enjoy the game  at present this is far from the case and it leaves an extremely poor play experience for player 2 s and even players 1 s to a certain extent  unless this is changed  the game is worthless to me and many others  therefore i cannot give any score other than 0 and to anyone saying that people giving negative reviews over a single  minor feature complaint  and are trying to counterbalance the score to drown out the whiners  remember that the people reviewing these low scores literally cannot experience the game that you are giving 10 s for because of this problem  expand
220,this is a game for people who love doing chores  in addition to crafting your own tools that break after 20 uses you also have to craft all the stores and the other villagers houses as well 
221,while the first player in the house will have a great time on this  all subsequent players will have a muted  limited experience i was not aware of the one island per console feature and this really does ruin the game for everyone else  i would not have bought this had i know  hopefully nintendo will do the right thing and patch this out 
222,i never make reviews unless i am very very disapointed or have a big pleasant surprise with a game  i bought animal crossing and seems like a great game until my kids found out it was one island per console  with 3 kids at home  yeah sure wtf  90  in canada including taxes and 1 cartridge isn t enough  greedy nintendo  never taught i would see this about your compagnie but duringi never make reviews unless i am very very disapointed or have a big pleasant surprise with a game  i bought animal crossing and seems like a great game until my kids found out it was one island per console  with 3 kids at home  yeah sure wtf  90  in canada including taxes and 1 cartridge isn t enough  greedy nintendo  never taught i would see this about your compagnie but during this pandemic stay at home moment you should think more human and not only about   sorry for bad english it is not my native language  expand
223,one save per console and local coop is somehow worse than playing alone  the second player cannot even access his her inventory and if p2 is fishing and p1 opens its inventory the fish will disappear  a shared camera view with the zoomed in camera demands that you stick together  but there is rarely anything for two players to do on the same screen  p2 just tags along and watches  whileone save per console and local coop is somehow worse than playing alone  the second player cannot even access his her inventory and if p2 is fishing and p1 opens its inventory the fish will disappear  a shared camera view with the zoomed in camera demands that you stick together  but there is rarely anything for two players to do on the same screen  p2 just tags along and watches  while also causing an annoyance for p1 because the camera view is shared  i bought this game to play with my gf and i wish i could return it now  expand
224,vegonzoso  solo se puede tener una isla por switch  pero es que ademas solo puede avanzar en el juego el jugador 1  los demas somos comparsas  esto es inaceptable  parchead  nintendo panda de ladrones 
225,it is 2020 and i will have to share the island with my brother  i just want to know why nintendo did such a thing  it is like they re telling us to enjoy the game the way they want
226,i have to rate this game a 0 like many others have said for the same reason is you cannot have more than one island per switch   the local multiplayer is a joke   the first person that does the tasks   gets the rewards and everyone else do not get share that joy  if you can have 4 people on an island on local coop and 8 people with online multiplayer visit your island   there is no reasoni have to rate this game a 0 like many others have said for the same reason is you cannot have more than one island per switch   the local multiplayer is a joke   the first person that does the tasks   gets the rewards and everyone else do not get share that joy  if you can have 4 people on an island on local coop and 8 people with online multiplayer visit your island   there is no reason why this game cannot be patched to give the same experience to everyone its the same story as others have mentioned already nintendo the year is 2020 not 1985   multiple game saves do exist   the nintendo switch do have on board memory and a sd card slot for extra storage  no worries it can handle it nintendo have designed animal crossing this way   they did this on purpose to force people to buy hardware and a second copy of the game  shameful  other than that is is a great game  too bad its not equal for everyone here is how the game should work with a single switch   johnny signs in with his nintendo profile   plays animal crossing   does his notasks and game progression   once done jane signs in with her profile  plays animal crossing  does her tasks and game progression want to play on the same island together  no problem   choose which island you want to play on and  when the 2nd player visits they cannotake some resources with them to share  both can continue to play together and farm resources that they can keep or trade   sounds simple  but nintendo do not want it that way bottom line is    to truly enjoy this game multiplayer you need two nintendo switches and two copies of the game  expand

228,cannot stop playing this is what i have been waiting for btw if you wouldo not like animal crossing then do not buy it because its more of the same so yeah if not its amazing
229,this is probably one of the weakest entries into the series to date  new mechanics have seemingly been added at the expense of older great mechanics  i am around 20 hours into the game and have my town setup along with several house expansions  the worst thing about this game is nothe complete and total lack of gyroids  why would nintendo remove a major staple of the ac universe  i amthis is probably one of the weakest entries into the series to date  new mechanics have seemingly been added at the expense of older great mechanics  i am around 20 hours into the game and have my town setup along with several house expansions  the worst thing about this game is nothe complete and total lack of gyroids  why would nintendo remove a major staple of the ac universe  i am seriously considering returning this game at this point because i could honestly go back and play any other ac game and have more fun than i have with new horizons  expand

234,to actually review this game i think you will need two scores  the first score being the game when you are citizen representative  you booted up the game first  and the second score when you are an additional player i was unlucky enough to boot the game second and am not a citizen representative and to be honest i stopped playing the game after two days  you always have a feeling youto actually review this game i think you will need two scores  the first score being the game when you are citizen representative  you booted up the game first  and the second score when you are an additional player i was unlucky enough to boot the game second and am not a citizen representative and to be honest i stopped playing the game after two days  you always have a feeling you have an inferior game where you are nothing more than a character on someone s island  you wouldo not get to name the island  you wouldo not get to build the structures on the island and you wouldo not get to contribute to most of the story which animal crossing has to offer my brother who is nothe citizen representative enjoys the game and it is really polished and has a nice gameplay loop  but i feel ripped off  to me  this game deserves nothing more than a 1 out of 10  because i really cannot live with the fact that my game is limited  if you pay  60 for a game  you want to fully enjoy it  now i just cannot because of these restrictions  expand

236,for those who are not familiar to the animal crossing franchise  animal crossing is a life stimulation game where you take your time to relax and explore your island as well as forming friendship with the villagers while doing outdoor activities such as bug catching and fishing as for new horizons the game is just pleasant to play  the control feels right  there is more events to do for those who are not familiar to the animal crossing franchise  animal crossing is a life stimulation game where you take your time to relax and explore your island as well as forming friendship with the villagers while doing outdoor activities such as bug catching and fishing as for new horizons the game is just pleasant to play  the control feels right  there is more events to do  the atmosphere is much more lively and what s more with the addition of terraforming allows players to build new path or destroying the edge of a cliff in their island to how they see fits  veterans of the animal crossing franchise fans will most likely appreciate all these new addition to the games the games does everything right in term of the gameplay but it does have some cons to it as well  nintendo have set restriction where you only can have one island on a switch which means that you cannot have multiple islands on the same console  it also restricted other profile users in your switch to perform activities in the island if you are not the owner of the island  therefore new horizon single player aspect is fun and all but if you are looking for a co op experience this game does really poorly on that aspect  expand

240,i am a veteran ac player  and while i like the game it definitely has its issues  a lot of this review is nitpicky  but at the end of the day if you enjoy life sims you will probably like this  it is overall a nice game pros almost total control over the layout of your island eventually more customization options for furniture  clothing and even your character than before hdi am a veteran ac player  and while i like the game it definitely has its issues  a lot of this review is nitpicky  but at the end of the day if you enjoy life sims you will probably like this  it is overall a nice game pros almost total control over the layout of your island eventually more customization options for furniture  clothing and even your character than before hd graphics are beautiful  the new museum in particular is stunning the music is great  and has a lot of callbacks to older games in the series villagers do a lot more things than they have in previous entries and have better dialogue than they did in nl  blathers will blather again if you let him seasonal events now last more than one day  a relief for those of us who have jobs but do not want to time travel extremely large pool of villagers certain redundant facilities were cut  like re tail new storage and inventory system is pretty great  lots of more items stack  storage automatically organizes your things tool and outfit rings streamline the ui nicely nook miles give a nice sense of direction when you just want to keep playing the game after doing most of the big tasks for the day crafting provides a nice alternative to waiting for items to show up at the store outfits are stored in the wand  which saves inventory space very relaxing atmospherecons touchscreen controls exist for typing  yet are not enabled for pattern creation or inventory use items that can stack have wildly varying limits  from 10 for fruit to 99 for weeds the tutorial is roughly a week long if you wouldo not time travel  and you wouldo not get to listen to hourly themes until this notutortial ends autosave system is near pointless because you can still save scum  even detrimental because you cannot save and continue anymore  leading to short rollbacks at times  resetti got fired for nothing seasonal events are locked behind drm lots of items and facilities considered series staples are out like gyroids and the roost  as are some of the best additions from nl like the dream suite  veterans are instead left to guess whether or not these might return through updates that may or may not be free villager dialogue is still relatively toned down if you are a fan of ww or pg no ability to move the town hall despite being able to move everything else not on the beach online functionality is not particularly reliable  while local multiplayer is messy and requires you to stay in the same area instead of just using split iscreen functionality  also you have to watch a long cutscene every time there is a visitor no option to disable the smoothing filter applied to patterns weapon durability in a series that generally did not have it is aggravating  and having the highest tier be breakable is actually a bit infuriating because it defeats the purpose of the best axe in particular tools are not stored in the tool ring like outfits are in the wand islands are tied to console and not cart  meaning you need to pay  300  360 if you bought digital like a sucker  instead of  60 to have your own if you were hoping to split up your household the mayor returns from nl in all but name  leaving players that come after them left with fewer gameplay options because they cannot terraform your regular inventory is not automatically organized like storage is many items are locked behind crafting crafting cannot be done in batches making a mistake in a long set of choices in dialogue often means starting from the beginning again  there is usually no option to go back to the previous choice you messed up  expand
241,this game is relaxing  fun  and a fantastic way to escape from the awful things that are going on in the world  fishing  crafting  selling  catching  it all just feels really rewarding 
242,the user score is almost ridiculous  sure i understood the problem  and the 1 island blah blah is a bad thing i agree  but could u make a real review and speak about the whole game too  because it is amazing and does not deserve a 0 or 1 at all  that s a fact  it is beautiful  charming  cute  colorful  full of old and new features  clearly the best animal crossing game in my opinion  youthe user score is almost ridiculous  sure i understood the problem  and the 1 island blah blah is a bad thing i agree  but could u make a real review and speak about the whole game too  because it is amazing and does not deserve a 0 or 1 at all  that s a fact  it is beautiful  charming  cute  colorful  full of old and new features  clearly the best animal crossing game in my opinion  you can do so many things and i am having a really good time with it and with my friends  and did you go to the museum  it is incredible  damn  i give the game a 9 10 for sure  but 10 10 is for counterbalance a lot of stupid rates   expand
243,i love it  with every day the game getting better  the long waiting has now ended

245,although the game has only been out for three days so far  i cannothoroughly say this has brought me so much joy  as a long time fan i can say this is a very faithful and innovative title in the series  the big pros introduced in this game that i see clearly are the introduction of crafting  innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration  and freedom to build your town howalthough the game has only been out for three days so far  i cannothoroughly say this has brought me so much joy  as a long time fan i can say this is a very faithful and innovative title in the series  the big pros introduced in this game that i see clearly are the introduction of crafting  innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration  and freedom to build your town how you like it with the moment of buildings introduced  there are many other pros too  such as character customization  the beauty of the game  especially seen in the museum  etc  however  the game does have flaws  the tool degradation feels like complete annoyance rather than sense of progression and challenge it ishould  which is only worsened by the crafting system lacking depth due to the only 8 or so crafting  materials ever used  this makes it feel very monotonous to craft things  as it would require more resources than your small island can provide  which leads you to go to other islands  using nook ticket  to get resources  which can become very tedious and somewhat too easy after your first few times  the game s pacing feels extremely slow compared to other animal crossing games  which does hurt when you are so limited in the beginning  other criticisms such as it lacking gyroids  present since ac population growing  being missing  a somewhat lacking roster of new villagers  fish and bugs feeling too easy to catch now  and the dreaded 1 island per console issue do bring the game down however  one criticism i wouldo not believe is valid is nothe introduction of holidays through updates  as they would be added by the time normal players would get there thus the only people who would complain is nothe time travelers  which is debatable if that s cheating or not  overall  i believe this is a great evolution of the animal crossing formula  with many small flaws that are common across franchises when such a large gap is between entries which is noto be expected  i would recommend this game to any previous animal crossing fan and anyone wanting to come into the franchise for the first time  expand
246,this game has been marketed as a game for family amd friends where the multiplayer was encouraged  yet if you wouldo not get to start the islamd  you are basically a roamer that aimlessly collects fruit  you give no contribution to the development of the island and are bound to the progress the first player decides to male  it feels like you wouldo not matter at all  you wouldo not even receive recipes orthis game has been marketed as a game for family amd friends where the multiplayer was encouraged  yet if you wouldo not get to start the islamd  you are basically a roamer that aimlessly collects fruit  you give no contribution to the development of the island and are bound to the progress the first player decides to male  it feels like you wouldo not matter at all  you wouldo not even receive recipes or anything    factor in the decision of one island per console and you can easily jump to the conclusion that nintendo wants every engaged player to own a console  and since the nintendo switch sits on a price range that s way higher than that of the nintendo 3ds this is just absurd     if you are alone the game is fine and perfect  if you share the console with other people the game will be cool just for the first player  and utterly boring and discriminating for the remaining players  also  if the first player stops playing  everyone is stuck and the only option is noto restart the game from zero  expand
247,edit  modifying my score from a 4 to a 0 due to more issues with only the primary player being able to do things around the island  i wouldo not recommend this gamei wouldo not want to review bomb a game  but i wouldo want to voice my opinion  this game is fantastic and i even enjoy the one island with multiple people  it ishould be an option but that s how i intended to play it anyway  but the factedit  modifying my score from a 4 to a 0 due to more issues with only the primary player being able to do things around the island  i wouldo not recommend this gamei wouldo not want to review bomb a game  but i wouldo want to voice my opinion  this game is fantastic and i even enjoy the one island with multiple people  it ishould be an option but that s how i intended to play it anyway  but the fact the first person has the entire control of the island is egregious  i bought it and let my roommate play it first while i finished up work and by the next day i loved the town already at which point i wouldiscover  which had not been mentioned anywhere prior to the games release  that he had all the control in perpetuity and there is nothing i can do about it  now i am five days in and not going to delete it but oh my god please nintendo  let us at least switch the island representative if not let everyone spruce up the town  and while you are at it let everyone have there own island to keep that dream alive for the rest of the reviewers here ps  i agree with the other people that mentioned it is odd none of the official reviewers really mentioned this  expand
248,this game has some great elements and it is a lot of fun for the first player to boot it up  for every other user who shares the switch console you are given a sub par experience  only the first player to start the game gets to experience the whole game  complete with building shops  completing tasks for nook  moving buildings  unlocking recipes  and generally continuing the storyline this game has some great elements and it is a lot of fun for the first player to boot it up  for every other user who shares the switch console you are given a sub par experience  only the first player to start the game gets to experience the whole game  complete with building shops  completing tasks for nook  moving buildings  unlocking recipes  and generally continuing the storyline  everyone else does not even get to help donate resources to building projects so their ability to progress in the game is limited by how much the primary player has unlocked  nintendo is basically trying to force households to buy multiple consoles and multiple copies of the game as that is nothe only way for everyone to get the full experience the island also does not have enough resources to go around when you have to share those resources with everyone else in your household who plays the game  it can easily create tension and arguments as players fight over the valuable resources like iron that are in limited supply but are needed for crafting  i love the animal crossing series and was really looking forward to this game  but since my husband happened to log on first  i wouldo not get to experience the game as it is meant to be  i am so frustrated that nintendo would limit us with this one island per console garbage  expand
249,really fun and chill game  encourages playing daily but not all day that is a nice change of pace  easy to lose yourself in  better multiplayer would be nice 
250,amazing  i wouldo not understand all these criticisms that you can only create one island per switch  if i were you i would confirm by researching the features that provide the game  this game has infinite possibilities  it is perfect  i love everything in this game
251,my first ac game  i wouldo not regret video reviews can be a little biased bc of the popularity of acnl  but it is a genuinely fun game to play  it ishould be noted more clearly that only one island can be created on a switch   that the community can be a bit toxic  as most communities are  for the way you choose to play the game  as of the time i am writing this review  a few days aftermy first ac game  i wouldo not regret video reviews can be a little biased bc of the popularity of acnl  but it is a genuinely fun game to play  it ishould be noted more clearly that only one island can be created on a switch   that the community can be a bit toxic  as most communities are  for the way you choose to play the game  as of the time i am writing this review  a few days after launch  there is a dupe glitch going around that has completely ruined the online trading market  i suspect this ll be patched relatively soon and hopefully the market will level out again soon after  the game itself is very fun to play   very addictive  luckily for me  i wouldid not run into the island limit problem  if you are the primary owner of your switch  and do not plan on letting others use it  this game is a must have  right up there with super mario odyssey   breath of the wild  expand
252,what an amazing comeback  i wouldo not mind about the fact that you can only have one island per switch  this put aside  it is a fantastic game  relaxing and wholesome  perfect for this work at home period 
253,i wouldo not understand why people are giving this game a 0 because of the lack of a feature that nintendo said would not be in the game previously and that was not in any previous animal crossing games  i can understand that it can be bad for families that share a switch  but you should not expect a feature that was denied by the creators of the game  also  you should not disregard the rest ofi wouldo not understand why people are giving this game a 0 because of the lack of a feature that nintendo said would not be in the game previously and that was not in any previous animal crossing games  i can understand that it can be bad for families that share a switch  but you should not expect a feature that was denied by the creators of the game  also  you should not disregard the rest of the entire game and give it a 0 for one reason  you should still base your review on the other parts of the game  too as for my review  i obviously cannot say how good the entire game is based on my 3 days  unless i time travel  but it is been amazing from what i play  there is just so much to do  and i never find myself feeling like i wouldid all i could for the day  there are also so many things that make the quality of life so much better  some of these are simple things  like items automatically stacking or bells automatically going into your wallet  but there are also larger changes like the tool wheel  the game is also a lot easier to play for longer periods of time compared to new leaf because it is not on a tiny 480p screen  not to discredit new leaf  that is also a great game  overall  i cannot say how good the full game is  but i can definitely give it a 10 based on the 3 days i have played through  expand
254,great game and so relaxing  if you liked the previous ones in the series you will this  many new features and enhanced but still charming graphics  must buy switch and switch kite game
255,nintendo is on a constant high note with the switch another best in the series for one more amazing ip if you were on the fence about getting in to animal crossing there is no better time to start  and if you are a fan this is a must

257,great game  love how i can interact with all the characters and the fishing i love it iso much
258,the single save system ruins the game  do not buy this game if you are sharing a switch with others only the first player to the game can make the most decisions progress   the rest of the players are left with the remains  in the old games you could buy a new cartridge or use a different memory card  but you cannot do that here   the data is saved directly onto the switch and cannot bethe single save system ruins the game  do not buy this game if you are sharing a switch with others only the first player to the game can make the most decisions progress   the rest of the players are left with the remains  in the old games you could buy a new cartridge or use a different memory card  but you cannot do that here   the data is saved directly onto the switch and cannot be moved to an sd card  the game is only worth it if you are the sole player  otherwise you should not buy this game until the horrible save system is removed  expand
259,you better hope you are the only one playing it  any other users  that do not play it first  have access to limited resources  i started the game and now my girlfriend  who plays it more than i wouldo  is bummed because she does not have access to certain things that i am only able to have access to  only because i started the game first  i understand the one island per switch  but when you startyou better hope you are the only one playing it  any other users  that do not play it first  have access to limited resources  i started the game and now my girlfriend  who plays it more than i wouldo  is bummed because she does not have access to certain things that i am only able to have access to  only because i started the game first  i understand the one island per switch  but when you start taking access away to other users who want to play the game  within the same household  is unacceptable  buying another switch for another user to gain full access to features  is unacceptable  nintendo  get your stuff together and release a patch to fix this  expand
260,fantastic game  do not let the one island per switch thing ruin the entire experience   there is more to the game  collecting  fixing the house  fishing  paying bills  finding new things  seeing other islands  terraforming and more 
261,if you have brothers  they cannot enjoy the full experience of the game because in nintendo are idi0ts and make one island per console in 2020 
262,this game sucks me and my brother wanted to play on the same island but because i am not the island founder i cant progress through the game i cant unlock any of the shops and museums just because i am not the founder also you can only make one island per switch so i cant even play on my own island and get the full experience on my game so why would nintendo on purpose make their gamethis game sucks me and my brother wanted to play on the same island but because i am not the island founder i cant progress through the game i cant unlock any of the shops and museums just because i am not the founder also you can only make one island per switch so i cant even play on my own island and get the full experience on my game so why would nintendo on purpose make their game worse for money they want me to have to buy my own switch just so i can also play the full game well guess what nintendo i am not going to give you more money you just lost a customer because of your greed and anti consumer bs also the crafting system is annoying i cant even tell when my tool is going to break what kind of horrible design is nothat they also took out the measuring system so their is even less stuff to do yaaaay make the game have less content this game can pound sand if you are playing by yourself i still would not recommend it just play new leaf or townsfolk those games have much more content and do not have that annoying tool system  expand
263,ignore the review bombing haters  this is nothe best in the series  sad that people have nothing better to do

265,this game could be fun if both my wife and i could enjoy it   however  it is only fun for one person as the second person to make a character is locked out of submitting things to the museum  inviting and moving villagers  and other decisions it is a gimped experience for everyone but the first player with no option to make multiple islands 
266,one island per console for all local profiles  progress locked to the first local profile to start the game  no warnings of any of this  everyone else is a second class citizen who cannot play independently whatsoever  full price disappointment  local co op totally gimped and basic features not available to second player  reviewers should not have missed this  shows how little video gameone island per console for all local profiles  progress locked to the first local profile to start the game  no warnings of any of this  everyone else is a second class citizen who cannot play independently whatsoever  full price disappointment  local co op totally gimped and basic features not available to second player  reviewers should not have missed this  shows how little video game journalists actually do their own research nowadays  expand

271,i have my own switch  so i have nothing to complain about  the game is amazing and i absolutely love it  it was worth buying on day 1 
272,gameplay itself is great if you are only user of switch  but if you have to share the console  expiriences may vary  forcing players to live on one island is questionable decision  this should be players choice 
273,let multiple islands happen on a single switch  unacceptable busy strategy to try and force people to buy more consoles  truly scum 
274,this game is awful if you plan to share it  2nd player is useless  they cannot progress the island  nor help build anything  it isucks  the reviewers never even tested this out  shoes how useless they truly are 
275,this game is completely awesome if you are the only one playing on a single switch  but having to share a switch and second players being degraded to a lesser status of not being able to progress the island completely ruins the two player experience on the same switch  do not plan on two people playing equally on the same switch 
276,very limited for households with multiple players  no option to create your own island and being the 2nd player to start means you miss out on most of the story parts of the game  and you have to wait for the 1st player to progress things before you can really do anything  it is a bit ridiculous and comes across as a money grab from nintento  trying to get people to buy multiple switchvery limited for households with multiple players  no option to create your own island and being the 2nd player to start means you miss out on most of the story parts of the game  and you have to wait for the 1st player to progress things before you can really do anything  it is a bit ridiculous and comes across as a money grab from nintento  trying to get people to buy multiple switch consoles and games per house  very disappointing  expand

281,one island per console  very family friendly  how unbelievably greedy by nintendo

288,just like every other recent reviewer giving it a negative score  nintendo made a selfish call locking only one user to be in control of the only island  this is unacceptable of a family oriented platform  so for evey family that has multiple kids or users  each one would have to own their own switch in order to have their own island and gather their own resources  what a scam  beforejust like every other recent reviewer giving it a negative score  nintendo made a selfish call locking only one user to be in control of the only island  this is unacceptable of a family oriented platform  so for evey family that has multiple kids or users  each one would have to own their own switch in order to have their own island and gather their own resources  what a scam  before writing this review i gave nintendo a 1 10 but now i am all fired up thinking of how much a of a cash grab this is it gets a big 0 10  good job nintendo  expand

290,got the game for my partner and i to enjoy in quarantine and am heartbroken over the restrictions placed on the second player  sharing one island is fine and cool but additional players not following the same progression and not having access to all the game s mechanics is noterrible this has to be fixed 
291,cannot have more than one island on the console  great when my girlfriend and me both want separate islands  literally unplayable for one of us

299,very disappointed you have to share one island with multiple people  there was no excuse for this noto be the case in this day and age and as such i am forced to give a score of 0  as this greatly impacts the gameplay  hopefully they come to their senses and fix this issue

338,this is a great relaxing game  i love it  it is nothe perfect game to play while listening to podcasts or watching tv with family  i could see why it would be frustrating if you were playing with someone else on the same console though  which is why i took off a point 
339,the game is absolutely fantastic and everything we have been waiting for for seven long years  the ability to truly customize your island and all of the quality of life upgrade make this game so very worth the money  it is a slow relaxing game that any fan of past animal crossing games would love 
340,this game is nothe best in the series by far but the multiplayer is a problem  i wouldo believe that it ishould be one island per cartridge at the least and not one island per switch  do not even bother with the local multiplayer  other than that this game is near perfect 
341,loving it iso far  my husband and i are playing together  admittedly we were a bit istumped at first about only having one island but it is been fun anyway  we keep leaving each other gifts and sending cute mail  it is probably the most romantic we have been in a bit lol  still a little confused about how you play online with friends  i want to visit their islands but i think that might costloving it iso far  my husband and i are playing together  admittedly we were a bit istumped at first about only having one island but it is been fun anyway  we keep leaving each other gifts and sending cute mail  it is probably the most romantic we have been in a bit lol  still a little confused about how you play online with friends  i want to visit their islands but i think that might cost extra and that is a little shady  but the gameplay is super relaxing and enjoyable  the customization options are awesome  it is so cute  i am honestly spending way more time on it than i expected  a little obsessed lol  expand
342,for me  animal crossing  new horizons has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year  as a single player experience  i would say going around and improving your island is relaxing and addicting  the nook miles system brings me back to the game everyday to try to save up for new rewards  the new crafting system also keeps me coming back to collect more materials  even with all offor me  animal crossing  new horizons has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year  as a single player experience  i would say going around and improving your island is relaxing and addicting  the nook miles system brings me back to the game everyday to try to save up for new rewards  the new crafting system also keeps me coming back to collect more materials  even with all of this  there is one huge issue that cannot be ignored that many others have complained about animal crossing fails the most at co op  the fact that you can only have one island per switch seems greedy  so that customers go out to buy more switches  even if you buy another copy of the game  it will not give you another island  that means me and my siblings are forced to live on one island  the leader and follower system can very annoying to deal with  especially if you areally want to get things done on your island  the leader retains all of the abilities a regular player would have  but the followers are basically glorified npcs  the followers cannot access their inventory or interact with other residents  followers can only use their tools and pick things up  when they do pick something up  it goes straight to the recycling bin  for the leader to potentially steal  or for a drawn out sequence where the players have to switch between leaders  it does not help that sometimes my siblings sometimes try to cuck me and steal my resources to sell  or for one of them to steal leader from me  it is also annoying that you can shake your controller to change leader  my siblings just shake my hands and steal leader  i would really like an option to turn that off  i wouldo not get why they locked these features to just one player  it really waters down the experience for me who was excited  since i ll be playing mostly co op with my siblings the biggest flaw with co op play  the thing that really kills the experience for me  has to be the island representative system  there can only be one island representative  the person who first opens the game  they are also the only person who is able to progress the story  along with other exclusive benefits like exclusive diy recipes  that would be fine if there was multiple save files  but the problem is nothere isn t  the other players that live on the island just have have a way worse experience  i am not saying it is not fun to play as a villager  i am just saying you are not getting the full experience  it can still be fun to decorate your house and to complete daily tasks i think this game is at its best when playing single player  co op at the moment is noterrible and not having extra saves can ruin the experience for many  also  please keep in mind i wouldo not have access to a single player save  i would recommend this game to people to people who have switches that only they use  this game just isn t made for multiple people to with  even if my siblings did cooperate with me  the game would still be 6  expand
343,as many have stated the pure stupidity behind the decision for one island per switch amazes me  literally just brought a switch for me and my partner with this game and one of us has to just be a tag along  imagine any other game doing this it would be stupid please change this 
344,the arbitrary limitation to allow only one island  and essentially  only one save file  is an incredibly anti consumer move that limits the potential of this game  it incentivises and requires those who want to have a complete experience of the game to buy a new switch system  or become side lined while the first account  player  to start the game gains the special privilege as the islandthe arbitrary limitation to allow only one island  and essentially  only one save file  is an incredibly anti consumer move that limits the potential of this game  it incentivises and requires those who want to have a complete experience of the game to buy a new switch system  or become side lined while the first account  player  to start the game gains the special privilege as the island leader  and all the benefits that come with that  of course  this only poses a problem if you are sharing the switch system  or want to play with your loved ones while having an equal experience  an ironic punishment considering the nature of family orientated nintendo gaming systems  this does not even include cloud saving restrictions  of which new horizons is not supported  expand
345,probably one of my favourite switch games 9 points because it does not have cloud saves and you can only have one island per console great game
346,honestly my favorite game to come out in the past few years  it is especially nice amid this covid 19 problem  just going to my happy place 
347,even if co op playing is a little awkward  this game is one of nintendo s great games  it inherited the advantages of acnl  and gave players a variety of consideration in terms of convenience 
348,extremely relaxing game with very fun npc s to interact with 10 10 
349,always been a huge animal crossing fan  since the original  i love all the tiny details nintendo included  it is just so cute  it is definitely making lockdown a lot more bearable 
350,this game makes me so happy  it is not incredibly story driven like a lot of today s games  but it is more about the day to day life of your villager  instead of checking off quests   deadlines  you set your own pace for how you want to play  do you want to cross pollinate flowers to make new colors  do you want to catch all the fish and find all the bugs  do you want to fill up your museum this game makes me so happy  it is not incredibly story driven like a lot of today s games  but it is more about the day to day life of your villager  instead of checking off quests   deadlines  you set your own pace for how you want to play  do you want to cross pollinate flowers to make new colors  do you want to catch all the fish and find all the bugs  do you want to fill up your museum  do you want to design a dream island  you can do all of that   the beauty of this game is nothat you get to choose what you want to do  it is not a game about stress  speed  time  combat  or achievements  although there are achievements  the game does not revolve around them  it is about enjoying yourself i wish nintendo had handled the multiplayer a bit differently  and i wish there were more things to do with friends when visiting their island vice versa  but ultimately this game is relaxing  adorable  and fun 10 10 would recommend  expand

352,the best game in the series  the amount of care and effort put into it is outstanding  definitely the only thing keeping me sane in this lockdown 
353,super fun game  i wouldo question tom nook s predatory lending practices  i owe him more than i wouldo my actual bank 
354,this game is fantastic so far  new horizons gives a stronger  better sense of progression and accomplishment than any previous animal crossing game  while the player character essentially starts from scratch on a deserted island  there is no shortage of things to do even within the first week  villagers are as charismatic as ever  and the catalogue of fish and bugs to catch  fossils tothis game is fantastic so far  new horizons gives a stronger  better sense of progression and accomplishment than any previous animal crossing game  while the player character essentially starts from scratch on a deserted island  there is no shortage of things to do even within the first week  villagers are as charismatic as ever  and the catalogue of fish and bugs to catch  fossils to discover  items to craft  and nookmiles rewards to earn is astounding  only a few days in  my wife and i have had multiple chance encounters with special npcs that add a sense of intrigue and wonder to the game  as a cherry on top  the game is also beautiful  the aesthetics  soundtrack  and sound design make for a soothing and satisfying experience i personally think the co op play is great  my wife and i inhabiting the same island is not an issue  and in fact we enjoy working together and surprising one another with our creative ideas and discoveries  while it would be nice if we both had all the freedoms that the leader position offers at once  it is so quick and easy to switch leaders that we have no problem tag teaming whatever we are working on  if i could ask for one thing  i would a split iscreen co op feature  however  the current system serves well in its own rite i am very excited to continue playing new horizons  developing our island  and making new discoveries  i appreciate the hard work that s gone into this game  and i am thankful in advance for the content updates that will continue to make this game an exciting and enjoyable experience  thanks  nintendo  expand

364,nintendo is nothe disney of video games  they are incredibly greedy and refuse to work with their fan base  one island per switch  no  money grubbing and asinine  if you are looking for another reason not to buy it  loading times in multiplayer are absurd  every single time someone comes to leaves from an island  everyone gets a 90 second loading screen 
365,just found out that i cannot actually enjoy any of this game s features  simply because my wife logged in first  this is nothe worst game design ever   fix this nintendo 
366,nintendo did this noto themselves  noone should need to buy a new console just to have another save state on a game  it would be a 10 if they thought of the customer for once 
367,having one island per console isn t even the worst part about this game  the fact that every other player   except the first person to boot up the game   cannot learn and perform more than 75  of the games functions is beyond unacceptable  at this point nintendo expects each switch console user to purchase their own switch with an additional animal crossing game if they want to play ac athaving one island per console isn t even the worst part about this game  the fact that every other player   except the first person to boot up the game   cannot learn and perform more than 75  of the games functions is beyond unacceptable  at this point nintendo expects each switch console user to purchase their own switch with an additional animal crossing game if they want to play ac at the same register as the island resident representative lol  this issue is clearly a money grabbing scheme and could easily be avoided by either 1  allowing everyone to be  resident representative  or 2  giving each player the option to either join someone else s island on their switch or create their own island  this function needs to be fixed as the game at this point is broken  and is very disappointing for the following types of demographics  couples who share a switch  siblings who share a switch  a parent and a child who want to play together  roommates who all pitched in to buy a switch together  you get my point  hopefully it can be fixed because currently customers are very dissatisfied with the results  expand

373,firstly  i would like to say  this is a game i would totally give a 9 or a 10 if it were not for some huge issues  animal crossing  new horizons is a fantastic single player experience and is nothe best game in the installment by far  the game is charming as always and the new crafting mechanic adds so much to the game as a whole  now  instead of catching bugs  fishing  and gathering fruit tofirstly  i would like to say  this is a game i would totally give a 9 or a 10 if it were not for some huge issues  animal crossing  new horizons is a fantastic single player experience and is nothe best game in the installment by far  the game is charming as always and the new crafting mechanic adds so much to the game as a whole  now  instead of catching bugs  fishing  and gathering fruit to sell to buy items  you can make your own tools and furniture  another great addition this game has is nothe deserted islands you can visit  you are allowed to visit ismall  deserted islands and gather as many resources there as you can hold to bring back to your island  this helps lower the time it takes to gather enough resources to build a new building or upgrade an old one  nook miles is a new addition as well   a currency that you get just by doing things like catching bugs  chopping down trees  and selling items for bells  this makes doing simple little things rewarded  nook miles plus allows you to do simple tasks like catch 5 bugs and then adds a new one right away for you to complete  here is the main issue with the game   for each copy of animal crossing you own  you can only have one island  this would be fine if it were just yourself playing  but other players cannot have their own experience and cannot do a lot of things in the game if they do not own the island  even if you have 2 nintendo switches  you can only have one island per copy of animal crossing you own  this makes the game so much less enjoyable for other players for no reason   nintendo could have easily allowed for multiple saves  in addition to that  islands cannot bew recovered via nintendo switch online which was a major selling point of nso   backups  nintendo will recover your island up to one time if you get a new system or break your old one  but after that  you are on your own  i wish nintendo would fix these issues  because if they did  this game would be nearly perfect  still  if you wouldo not plan on breaking your switch and are not playing with anyone else  i cannot reccomend this game enough  expand

382,having the first player that creates the island completely drive the story and gate all other players is just ridiculous  fix this 
383,i hope improving your bottom line was worth it because it was done at the expense  of the relationships  of families who can only afford one switch 
384,i love this game with a passion and i am so glad it is finally back  almost everything about the game is amazing  i said almost  the single island per console limit is quite annoying since anyone other than first resident cannot do much other than get bells and build a house 
385,i have been excited for this game since the first nintendo direct that announced it  but i started up doom eternal first and handed the switch off to my wife so she could play ac  she has maybe a dozen or more hours on it now  and i am done with doom eternal  only to find out i cannot have my own island and my progress is limited by her  i am disappointed enough that i amight use the termi have been excited for this game since the first nintendo direct that announced it  but i started up doom eternal first and handed the switch off to my wife so she could play ac  she has maybe a dozen or more hours on it now  and i am done with doom eternal  only to find out i cannot have my own island and my progress is limited by her  i am disappointed enough that i amight use the term heartbroken to describe how i feel  the decision nintendo made to do this is almost infuriating and there is no way i am buying a separate console to play one game  i am giving this 1 star because my wife seems to be enjoying it  i guess i ll have to wait another few years till she s bored of it and does not mind me wiping her savesave to finally get to play it  what a tremendous waste of money  expand
386,will not be playing  or coerced into bending over and taking  360 in the gyroid  fix the one island bs  selfish nintendo  we buy you for our kids  you are like the nanny that beats your children and steals from you while you are at work  updates required 
387,really disappointed that i cannot have my own island  what s worse is nothat the role of player 2 is so constrained that i essentially am not able to experience the game at all  this design choice will certainly make me more skeptical of future nintendo products 
388,do not buy this if you are planning on playing couch co op  i ended up returning it due to the lack of involvement my partner was allowed 
389,this is not a multiplayer game  it will likely become one when nintendo figures out how to charge people another  60 for the functionality 
390,nintendo did a really cool thing where the first player to make their character on your switch is nothe only player who actually has access to the entire game  i cannot give resources to tom nook for building upgrades or progress my town in any meaningful way  i cannot for the life of me understand why nintendo thought that only 1 8 people should be the one to have access to all of the gamenintendo did a really cool thing where the first player to make their character on your switch is nothe only player who actually has access to the entire game  i cannot give resources to tom nook for building upgrades or progress my town in any meaningful way  i cannot for the life of me understand why nintendo thought that only 1 8 people should be the one to have access to all of the game leaving 7 other players with a demo version i was about to buy a freaking switch lite and another copy of ac nh  until i realized i cannot transfer saves  good moves nintendo  game is essentially unplayable unless the primary player is giving you a play by play update of everything that s happening on their end and even then secondary players cannot even give those resources to the npc s that need them  this is basically like how in sonic and knuckles the person who plays tails is just aimlessly flying around the level where as sonic is nothe actual one who s really in control  expand
391,one island per switch  horrible horrible decision  by the time my kids are finished playing and its my turn  all the fruit is picked  trees chopped down and rocks cracked  i could go on and on  zero points 
392,one island per switch makes it unplayable for me  wish i could return the game since we know nintendo will not change it
393,the fact that the second player is so limited is complete bs  come on who approved this dumb system 
394,nintendo has a knack for releasing one of a kind  otherwise fantastic games that are dragged into the mud by one or two miserable  features  new horizons delivers almost everything that was promised but pulls its hand back on one feature  multiplayer  while the limitation of one island per switch was announced prior to launch the limitations forced on players not the islandnintendo has a knack for releasing one of a kind  otherwise fantastic games that are dragged into the mud by one or two miserable  features  new horizons delivers almost everything that was promised but pulls its hand back on one feature  multiplayer  while the limitation of one island per switch was announced prior to launch the limitations forced on players not the island representative  all progress on the island  such as crafting recipes  buildings  and public works are locked behind the first person to play the game on a system  secondary players likewise do not receive anything from progressing the game s  story  such as awarded crafting recipes  items  money  or any unique character dialogue or cutscenes tied to them  such as when completing the museum or town hall  local multiplayer is likewise gutted  with the camera  inventory  and npc interaction being tied exclusively to the session s leader  online multiplayer is not much better  being essentially the same as new leaf s without its mini game island or any equivalent  which was a good portion of the online content for that game  these make for an extremely underwhelming and downright frustrating multiplayer experience that is difficult for even the most easily entertained to enjoy  which is particularly upsetting as the game  at its core  is extremely fun and almost everything you could hope for from an animal crossing game i have my doubts nintendo will address this issue  they have ignored other key product issues  such as joy cons drifting and poor online services  to burying their head in the sand and hoping it will blow over  i sincerely hope that they are not successful in skirting responsibility on this one  this is a decision made out of pure greed to sell more switch systems  that thankfully  could not have been made at a worse time  i wouldo hope nintendo patches the game to allow multiple islands per system  or at the very least  improve the gameplay of secondary residents  expand
395,i want to give this game a good review  i really do  however  the one island per console thing just kills the game for me  i was totally ok with sharing an island with my spouse  but we do not share the island  everyone who starts the game after the first person is a glorified visitor   i realize this was a thing in older animal crossing games  but as far as i know  you could at least buy ai want to give this game a good review  i really do  however  the one island per console thing just kills the game for me  i was totally ok with sharing an island with my spouse  but we do not share the island  everyone who starts the game after the first person is a glorified visitor   i realize this was a thing in older animal crossing games  but as far as i know  you could at least buy a second copy of new leaf if you wanted to have your own experience  tying the island to the console instead of the cartridge is just ridiculous  if nintendo decides to fix this nothen i will be happy to write a new glowing review  as far as i cannotell if you are the only person in your household interested in playing then it is a great game  as for my score  i know a lot of people are arguing that it is unfair to review bomb because we are not complaining about the actual gameplay but i watched every official trailer and nintendo direct about the game  nowhere does it isay your experience may be limited if you share a console  i understand that it was like this in older games  but not all of us played the older games  to for some people  this is notheir first animal crossing and something this knuckleheaded can actually ruin the franchise for them  my 0 score is my plea for nintendo to at least patch it iso each unique cartridge can generate an island  expand
396,one island per switch is such a greedy money grab  0 10 you can do better than this 
397,only allowed 1 file per switch  an absolute slap in the face for a family system  want to clear the trees of fruit in the morning  anyone who plays in the evening cannot pick fruit  want to plant flowers around your house  your little brother can remove em any time  gonna play for several months but your sibling only wants to try it out  their tent is nothere perm  absolutely garbage 
398,you can only create one island per switch do not buy this if you have multiple players in your house planning to play the game  was excited to share this game with spouse  so disappointed to learn that we need to buy another switch and another copy of the game to play together  greedy ass decision  nintendo 
399,news flash  you will have no fun if anyone else in your household wants to play this besides you  they seriously pulled the dumbest  greediest looking move ever  they made it iso you can only have 1 island per switch console  does not matter if you have different profiles or not  does not matter that you bought a game you own  no one island per smitch  thats such bs  theyve lost many sales fromnews flash  you will have no fun if anyone else in your household wants to play this besides you  they seriously pulled the dumbest  greediest looking move ever  they made it iso you can only have 1 island per switch console  does not matter if you have different profiles or not  does not matter that you bought a game you own  no one island per smitch  thats such bs  theyve lost many sales from myself and family because this a poor decision  worse than loot boxes in star wars nothing else matters  becca s this restriction exist  expand
400,do not buy this game if you have more people playing on one switch  it is a good game for the first player that enters the game  but the next player that wants to start the game is strictly limited in his gameplay 
401,my bf started playing before me  no option to create my own island and being the 2nd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  you have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience  that s unacceptable 
402,this review contains spoilers  click expand to view                                                                                             so great game if you are the first player  however  if you are playing local multiplayer with your family the game is absolute trash  everything in the game is progress locked behind the first player  whoever came up with the resident representative idea has no idea what animal crossing should be hopefully at some point nintendo removes this so that all players can play the game equally  expand
403,the multiplayer sucks on this one  they might as well say it is single player on the store page  and by the way  1 island per switch  how on earth you people do not have 1 switch per family member at this point   s
404,the game is great for one person per day as once one player has done something on the island the other player has no purpose for that whole day and cannot progress at all the perfect fix for the game would be one  island  per switch but sub island s which are un editable by accounts who dont own that sub island  or better yet just an option for cloud saves or 2 islands 
405,it is so ridiculous that only one player has access to all of the features of the game  i allowed my younger sister to play the game before me  and now as player two i will not be able to do everything  shame on you nintendo for your greed and laziness 
406,payed for a switch  payed for an online subscription  payed for the game  cannot even enjoy it fully because i am player 2 never again
407,we have 3 daughters that play this game and i have got to say  terrible decision to only allow 1 island per switch   really leaves a bad taste in my mouth towards nintendo   i cannot imagine they did not see these issues as being a problem before release  which  i think  makes them terrible  greedy people   here i thought they were a family priority company   disgraceful 
408,the local multiplayer is noterrible  for an idea of the target audience  the settings only have 2 options  and has a raccoon tell you to get your parents before using them  i tried to get my money back  but nintendo s return policy isn t as good as steams 
409,it is great fun  for one person per console  but some serious oversight regarding local multiplayer progression hampers the main point of such a communal video game experience  simply allowing others to contribute to town building projects instead of locking them behind the main account holder would vastly improve the game  the fact that only one person can access the construction boxesit is great fun  for one person per console  but some serious oversight regarding local multiplayer progression hampers the main point of such a communal video game experience  simply allowing others to contribute to town building projects instead of locking them behind the main account holder would vastly improve the game  the fact that only one person can access the construction boxes for new resident plots is case and point of this poor design  expand
410,extremely limited game if you are sharing the island  as the seccond account  there is not much tou can do to interact with the game world 
411,forced to play on same island as roommate who logs on first everyday i get minimal resources  and they get to decide every house and building location  waste of money 
412,unreal that i am stuck without a shovel because my wife was the first user on our switch   had no idea the first player on the island needed to progress first  should give some warning   love the game but this is a big eff up 
413,i wouldo not like to give unreasonable ratings to games but i hope nintendo realizes that they made a mistake forcing people to buy multiple switches in order to play this game with their friends   i spent  60 on this game to escape the resource sharing nightmare of being quarantined with 4 people in my household indefinitely   i expected the peace and tranquility of my own island  and the funi wouldo not like to give unreasonable ratings to games but i hope nintendo realizes that they made a mistake forcing people to buy multiple switches in order to play this game with their friends   i spent  60 on this game to escape the resource sharing nightmare of being quarantined with 4 people in my household indefinitely   i expected the peace and tranquility of my own island  and the fun of sharing that island with  visitors  hoping my housemates would start their own islands on our shared switch  the second day with this game i learned that is not an option  not only are my housemates forced to share the same island with me  the resources on my island are shared between all of us   anybody can move anything outside of their houses anywhere on the island  playing local coop is completely brain dead for the second player  like bad enough that an intelligent child would get bored of it instantly  my experience with this game went from a peaceful private getaway to a mirror of the frustrating situation of being trapped in a too small space with too many people indefinitely   if there was ever a game that can reproduce the annoyance and fatigue of sharing an apartment with 4 other people in viral quarantine  it is this game   if you have one switch and multiple people who want to play this game  do not bother   i really want to play it  i really want to like it  there are so many things about it that seem great for a single person to enjoy  but the multiplayer mechanics have made it impossible for me to appreciate these things  i would have paid  60 to avoid the disappointment and frustration this game has made me feel   anyways  bad move nintendo  i really do not understand the thought here unless it was a financial one  please learn from this mistake  expand
414,multiplayer is horrible you have to guess when your friend is in online shared mode to join them just to add them to your ingame friend list to message them  one island per switch is also a bad move and seems like this game have less items then previous games
415,the game is amazing  beutifull and totally remmebers me my childhood  but this limitation that only main account cannotrigger main events  im fine with having only one island  specially i bought the game to play with my girlfrind and i think its pretty good being able to be in the same island but in the other hand  not being able to experience full game with a secondary account  thatsthe game is amazing  beutifull and totally remmebers me my childhood  but this limitation that only main account cannotrigger main events  im fine with having only one island  specially i bought the game to play with my girlfrind and i think its pretty good being able to be in the same island but in the other hand  not being able to experience full game with a secondary account  thats so bad  finally feel like farming materials for the main account  like  if the owner of this main account is not playing  you have to connec to his account to trigger new events and follow with the story  so bad and i complay because i cannot understand the reason behind  expand
416,really need to fix multiple people on one console  i have 3 grils and each one wants to play this game  i cannot afford to buy them each their own switch  there is no option to create a new island and being the 2nd player or 3rd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  youreally need to fix multiple people on one console  i have 3 grils and each one wants to play this game  i cannot afford to buy them each their own switch  there is no option to create a new island and being the 2nd player or 3rd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  you have to buy a 2nd console  or 3rd in my case  if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience  that s unacceptable  expand
417,normally  i would give this game an 8 out of 10  but i can not believe nintendo would allow a first person release that is so incredibly crippled  against better judgement i wouldecided to try the game knowing that there is only one island per switch  i have never played animal crossings games before so did not realize how annoying that would be  however  they made is worse since the personnormally  i would give this game an 8 out of 10  but i can not believe nintendo would allow a first person release that is so incredibly crippled  against better judgement i wouldecided to try the game knowing that there is only one island per switch  i have never played animal crossings games before so did not realize how annoying that would be  however  they made is worse since the person that creates the island holds everyone else back  i wouldo not have time to play right now  but my son is home and he is essential stuck since i wouldo not have time to play  maybe i amissed something or did not understand when setting everything up  but that for all companies to be that anti consumer i would have never guessed nintendo  just seems like a cash grab from a company that has one of the hottest systems ruining a game that would be very good otherwise  expand
418,so they disabled cloud saves even though i am paying  20 year for that  next  you cannot have more than one island per console  so if me and my sister wanted separate islands  we would have to spend  360 dollars to buy an entire new switch just to have 2 islands  oh and do not forget that certain features of the game are only available to the player who created the island  so single player isso they disabled cloud saves even though i am paying  20 year for that  next  you cannot have more than one island per console  so if me and my sister wanted separate islands  we would have to spend  360 dollars to buy an entire new switch just to have 2 islands  oh and do not forget that certain features of the game are only available to the player who created the island  so single player is broken for everyone except the island creator  oh and they made it a lot harder to time travel in the game  on the 3ds animal crossing  i would set my game time 2 hours different because i like to play every morning at around 6 00 am and my school starts at 8 00 am  everything important in the game happens at 8  so i just set the time so that when it is actually 6  the game thinks it is 8 00  now it is harder to change the in game time  so i literally cannot play the game because everything important happens while i am in school  wow  nintendo s first party games are getting so bad  the older ones like smash  mario kart  botw  etc  were really good but animal crossing  luigi s mansion 3  and mario maker 2 are all really bad  their online is absolutely screwed  i cannot believe they make me pay  20 for a broken system  do not buy this game  expand
419,so no cloud saves  only 1 island per console  and everyone except player 1 is screwed over to just collecting flowers  do not buy this
420,broken multi player ruined the game  the local co op is nothe most poorly designed game mechanic i have ever seen  why could not they just make it isplit iscreen like every other game  ever  beyond that the fact that everyone on a one switch has to share an island is nothe most desperate attempt to get people to but more switches 
421,be great if i could play the game  one island per console and the nonsense resident rep makes it impossible for multiple people to play this game  i am locked out of most of the game because the first player hasn t unlocked everything yet  hardly a family game for what one would consider the most family friend console  worst ac to date if things are not fixed and i have played almost every game 
422,great game  but nintendo needs to fix the multiplayer couch issue  every player s account on the switch should be able to access everything and progress  there is no sense of community with just 1 leader and the other players not being able to make major decisions  i wouldo not mind the one island per console  
423,this game is notruly a 1 player game  i bought it because it isaid up to 8 players  such a lie  false advertising and makes kids very sad  you need a switch per player to really enjoy the game  it has made kids everywhere cry  big mistake nintendo 
424,while the game is amazingly fun and i cannot seem to put it down  whenever i find a bit of free time  there are quite a few things that kind of put a damper on it    one island per console  as everyone else has complained about    not having a quick way to open close your gates without having to go to your airport  having to close your gates to visitors just to spend miles and bells onwhile the game is amazingly fun and i cannot seem to put it down  whenever i find a bit of free time  there are quite a few things that kind of put a damper on it    one island per console  as everyone else has complained about    not having a quick way to open close your gates without having to go to your airport  having to close your gates to visitors just to spend miles and bells on things at the kiosk there were a few other things but nothing too big  expand
425,lol 1 island per switch and my wife played first  so i am   out of luck huh wont buy the next nintendo console  easy decision for me 
426,bought this noto play with my girlfriend for local couch co op  but all the second player can do is fish and pick stuff up  it is not really co op  you have a glorified helper  super boring  if you bought this for co op like i wouldid  reconsider 
427,multiplayer is a joke  when your family members cannot play the game on their own profile 
428,this review is written from someone who shares a console with other users  so the review will reflect that experience  sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing  and leaves much to be desired  progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who does not play as the primary island inhabitant  there is no shared progression toward islandthis review is written from someone who shares a console with other users  so the review will reflect that experience  sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing  and leaves much to be desired  progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who does not play as the primary island inhabitant  there is no shared progression toward island milestones  and key items or crafting abilities are not distributed in the same manner  leaving an imbalanced playing experience  players who are not the first to set foot on the island are demoted to mere scavengers of resources  with limited contribution to island development  the choice to not have separate islands for separate players  and to limit the developmental experience for players that share the island  is highly disappointing  and appears to be the greatest complaint with the game   it became very apparent that this was a poor system wheat the point in the game where the first set of new inhabitants are joining the island and the primary player is given some dozen new crafting recipes and the objective of placing and furnishing several new homes across the island  secondary players during this notimeframe get none of the same recipes  are merely told to talk to the primary resident for instructions  and cannot contribute in any way to the progression aside from collecting raw materials like mindless robots  not quite the shared gaming experience people are looking for  certain choices like these made the experience feel extremely imbalanced and truly disappointing from the standpoint of someone who might not be the primary inhabitant  the only reason i could see nintendo choosing to design the game in this way is noto persuade people to have multiple consoles and copies of the game  one island per console is just not a good approach and could have been much better had single console multi player been designed more intelligently  expand
429,cannot believe the game only allows 1 island per console  absolutely terrible 
430,the inability to control what i can do with a game is nothe product of a bygone era  locking island generation to the console and not the cartridge is absolute garbage  then not restricting what the secondary players can do to improve the island and move the gameplay forward is just pure capitalist bull  which should be ironic seeing as this is a game whose very plot is outlined by athe inability to control what i can do with a game is nothe product of a bygone era  locking island generation to the console and not the cartridge is absolute garbage  then not restricting what the secondary players can do to improve the island and move the gameplay forward is just pure capitalist bull  which should be ironic seeing as this is a game whose very plot is outlined by a capitalist raccoon  1 10 would not buy again  expand
431,i was really looking forward to playing and creating my own island on the switch  my girlfriend loves animal crossing more than i wouldo so i let her make an island and play the game first  come to find out that i cannot even play now because there is only 1 island  it is just very upsetting  please fix the console situation
432,  that   with the only one island per switchi literally just bought the game before i found out and now i am stuck with it the game s apparently good  but   that anticonsumer bull  why did you change  it instead of keeping what you had before  it was so cool when my brother and i figured out that each switch profile had a different save in botw  that was one of the major  that   with the only one island per switchi literally just bought the game before i found out and now i am stuck with it the game s apparently good  but   that anticonsumer bull  why did you change  it instead of keeping what you had before  it was so cool when my brother and i figured out that each switch profile had a different save in botw  that was one of the major appeals of staying on the switch  please do not set this prescedent still mainly a pc gamer  bit i really like the switch  please do not ruin it and whatever bull  article i clicked to get here    off  this is definitely worth a review bomb  especially because it is the only thing is consumers can do to be heard  expand
433,the couch coop is awful  absolutely awful  the inability to access your pocket  having to scroll through aaallllll your tools  no option for split iscreen and being forced to follow player 1  not being able to talk to villagers or participate in any activities  it is just straight up bad  i find playing as player 2 to be worse than just watching someone play my other issue  and this one isthe couch coop is awful  absolutely awful  the inability to access your pocket  having to scroll through aaallllll your tools  no option for split iscreen and being forced to follow player 1  not being able to talk to villagers or participate in any activities  it is just straight up bad  i find playing as player 2 to be worse than just watching someone play my other issue  and this one is huge  in my opinion  is nothe limitations placed on each console  the fact that it is not only 1 island per console  but that s it is only one primary player per console is ridiculous  i have heard people argue that this is nothe same as what they did with new leaf  it is not  the switch is a  400 family console  it has numerous games marketed to families and groups  it is not reasonable to expect people to spend  300 400 on a second  and third  or fourth  console plus the additional costs of  90 per game just so everyone in a household can have the same experience nintendo screwed up  the single player content is amazing  but the absolute fail when more than one person in a household wants to play all but ruins the entire game for me  expand
434,both me and my little sister were excited for this game and i payed 80  to find out there is only one island per console  this is infuriatingly stupid that a console with the ability to have multiple accounts and games where iseparate accounts have their own personal saves cannot have separate games when switching accounts  playing on someone s else s island takes all the fun out of the gameboth me and my little sister were excited for this game and i payed 80  to find out there is only one island per console  this is infuriatingly stupid that a console with the ability to have multiple accounts and games where iseparate accounts have their own personal saves cannot have separate games when switching accounts  playing on someone s else s island takes all the fun out of the game so now i wouldo not want to play a game that i spent 80  on  not everybody has enough money to buy multiple switch s  one purchase per household should be enough forcing families to buy multiple consoles is extremely greedy it iseems those corporate dickheads at nintendo are showing their true colours  expand
435,my roommate bought this game for us to play on my switch  i let her play first on the primary account and i just spent the past few hours playing on a second account  i cannot progress the island at all leaving me hardly anything to do after just starting the game  i have lost all interest in playing the game already 
436,this game was ruined for me by the singular island garbage  it needs to be fixed 
437,great game if you are player 1  for everyone else on the same switch  it is a fraction of the game 
438,absolutely brilliant game  by far the best addition to the animal crossing series so far i have played around 15 hours since the release day 3 days ago  and i love every aspect of it  the graphics are so much more crisp than the previous titles  the amount of in game items is almost overwhelming  in a good way  and it gives me something to look forward to playing every day 
439,let us begin by being extremely clear  this game is amazing  it deserves all the praise you ve heard about it  it is fun  it is innovative for the series  it is really zen and  most importantly  it istill conveys that sense of belonging to a community when playing you probably are also reading a lot of angry people saying that the game only allows one island per switch console  and not perlet us begin by being extremely clear  this game is amazing  it deserves all the praise you ve heard about it  it is fun  it is innovative for the series  it is really zen and  most importantly  it istill conveys that sense of belonging to a community when playing you probably are also reading a lot of angry people saying that the game only allows one island per switch console  and not per switch user  that is correct  i agree with those people that this should not be the case  and while i can see it being an issue if you have multiple kids and or other people in your household that want to play different islands  i wouldo not think that fact alone makes it deserve a bad score  since that s about the only thing you will read in the negative reviews what things do i like about the game graphics are gorgeous and cute it is fun and adorable it really helps out relieve anxiety it has steps taken into making sure other people cannot destroy your island with the best friends systemwhat things i wouldo not like about it the multiplayer is a bit istrange  specially to connect online to other people  but not a whole lot of an issue either the 1 island per switch is not idealall in all  this is a 10 10 game  if you are the one player in your household  go for it  if you share the switch with someone else  maybe do a bit of research first and see if the restrictions are good or bad for your particular case  expand
440,despite people pointing out the obvious flaws  which is nothat only one island per system can be created  despite being a feature that has always existed in animal crossing even on home consoles  this game is a great addition to the already amazing series 
441,obsessed with this game   been playing the series since i was 5 and new horizons is an amazing experience
442,while no master piece  this game is still a fantastic entry in the ac series  while it istarts slow  overtime it introduces new concepts and qol improvements that fans have requested for multiple entries  it also has limitless gameplay potential which means you can rack up a ton of hours without really trying  some of the local options and shoddy changes hold this game back from a perfectwhile no master piece  this game is still a fantastic entry in the ac series  while it istarts slow  overtime it introduces new concepts and qol improvements that fans have requested for multiple entries  it also has limitless gameplay potential which means you can rack up a ton of hours without really trying  some of the local options and shoddy changes hold this game back from a perfect score however  but this game is definitely worth the price of admission  the graphics are iconic and crisp and every song in the soundtrack is worth listening to  i am only about 15 hours in  but i have seen what the game has to offer towards endgame and cannot wait to build my deserted island into a bustling village  8 5 10  expand
443,the game is exceptional  it is so much fun to build an island and watch it develop with each day  every day there is something to do and goals to accomplish  sure  the only having one island on one switch is annoying but not enough to detract from the game in a major way 
444,people complaining about the one island per console thing forget that this is how animal crossing has literally always been  there is never been an animal crossing game where you have more than one town on a single system  why would they change that now 
445,like many people here isaid before  the game itself is fine but the way the game handles shared save files is ridiculously bad  the worst i have ever seen in any videogame to be honest there is only one shared island per switch  not cardridge   switch  and the player that happens to be the first on the island is nothe only one that can basically play the game  the others are consideredlike many people here isaid before  the game itself is fine but the way the game handles shared save files is ridiculously bad  the worst i have ever seen in any videogame to be honest there is only one shared island per switch  not cardridge   switch  and the player that happens to be the first on the island is nothe only one that can basically play the game  the others are considered villagers and are more like active spectators  than actual players  there is no way to interact with quests or progress in the game if you are not the one person starting the game  my gf and i wanted to share this game  instead she is playing it 95  since i can not experience or progress the story at all  until this is fixed i hope noone buys this game and forces nintendo to patch this   i really wanted to play this  i was hyped since its announcement  this just makes me soo mad at this game  expand
446,i created an account just for this review  this is an amazing game and the calmness of this game is amazing  if you want to have a good time and just chill play this game 
447,i am honestly quite in love with the game  especially due to the current circumstances keeping everyone at home  it is a great new addition to the series  adding in an interesting crafting system along with a lovely rewards program right off the bat  while i wouldo wish i could have my own island on the shared system i use  i understand it is in the same style as how animal crossing has been donei am honestly quite in love with the game  especially due to the current circumstances keeping everyone at home  it is a great new addition to the series  adding in an interesting crafting system along with a lovely rewards program right off the bat  while i wouldo wish i could have my own island on the shared system i use  i understand it is in the same style as how animal crossing has been done in the past  it would be terrific if they added multiple islands as a possible update  but it does not make or break the game  the resources for the crafting system do feel slightly iffy   as rocks seem to only spawn once per day and it takes fruit two days to reappear   however the game is a yet again a terrific addition to the series and i look forward to all the futures events within it  expand
448,only one island per switch  me and my girlfriend were really looking forward to playing  game is ok but i am not paying 300 on a new switch to get another island 
449,this is an incredible game for the first user to make a character  anyone else who plans on playing only gets part of the action  players 1 makes all of the decisions while everyone else has to wait on player 1  if player 1 isn t very active  well too bad for everyone else  you must buy another switch for each person if they do not want to be treated as 2nd class  my family is sothis is an incredible game for the first user to make a character  anyone else who plans on playing only gets part of the action  players 1 makes all of the decisions while everyone else has to wait on player 1  if player 1 isn t very active  well too bad for everyone else  you must buy another switch for each person if they do not want to be treated as 2nd class  my family is so disappointed  we knew one island per switch was coming and we accepted that but the hamstringing of everyone but player 1 really kills the vibe  it also puts undue pressure on player 1 to make progress or feel guilty for holding everyone else back  families do not need a game causing stress like that  we could just play monopoly or mario party if we want to have hard feelings with each other  expand
450,complete scam  in order to access all the features advertised as being included in the game you are required to buy an extra switch for every person in the household and a new copy of the game for each of them  i should not have to spend an extra  1000 just to be able to play the game i already paid for 
451,love love love this new addition to the animal crossing saga  so many things to do and it is so much fun 
452,friendly  a nice online system  everyday you will find something new  the crsfting look so great
453,seeing animal crossing in hd is amazing  having to build everything from the ground up makes you even more eager to unlock everything  and the addition of nookmiles  that you are given for everyday tasks  makes the game even more addicting to play  as a former new leaf and wild world player i would definitely recommend this game

455,juego excelente  y muy adictivo  100  recomendable  aún y cuando no hayas jugado las entregas anteriores
456,very fun and relaxing game  the design of the character are very nice  especially the animals like tom nook where you can even see the little fur instead of a simple color gradient  sure the game have its faults  but it is very accessible and everyone can enjoy it 
457,animal crossing new horizons is nothe game the world needed at this bleak point in history  the island is beautiful  the dialogue is charming  and it fulfills the needs i want from an animal crossing game  if you come into this franchise expecting dramatic quest plotlines  you will be disappointed  this is a game about sitting back  making friends and enjoying a quiet life  animal crossinganimal crossing new horizons is nothe game the world needed at this bleak point in history  the island is beautiful  the dialogue is charming  and it fulfills the needs i want from an animal crossing game  if you come into this franchise expecting dramatic quest plotlines  you will be disappointed  this is a game about sitting back  making friends and enjoying a quiet life  animal crossing new horizons is not a game that can be binged if you want to get the full experience  it is something you play a little of a day  i look forward to continuing to enjoy my island one day at a time  expand
458,animal crossing is a charming game that is a fantastic upgrade from previous entries in the series  the game is visually gorgeous and adds so many details and things to discover for players  in the game the player has many options to make the island their own through the freedoms of placing anything outside to terraforming it to your liking  i have already put in almost 40 hours in and hopeanimal crossing is a charming game that is a fantastic upgrade from previous entries in the series  the game is visually gorgeous and adds so many details and things to discover for players  in the game the player has many options to make the island their own through the freedoms of placing anything outside to terraforming it to your liking  i have already put in almost 40 hours in and hope i can keep playing for a long time  while being limited to one island may seem terrible to many seeking their own islands on the same switch animal crossing is meant to be a social expierence with friends and family members  animal crossing is also a large game for the switch and as the switch stores user data on the console i would imagine multiple islands would take a large amount of space without an sd card  i have enjoyed playing with my family and will continue loving this game that has so much passion and detail put into it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to relax or have fun  expand
459,it is a good game  well designed  good art direction  lots to create  it is not a game for everybody  but if you are even a little creative you will enjoy it and it will be relaxing fun  however the game does drop a point for me due to the forced sharing of an island on the same console  it has always been part of the franchise  but it was largely due to technological limitations in my opinion it is a good game  well designed  good art direction  lots to create  it is not a game for everybody  but if you are even a little creative you will enjoy it and it will be relaxing fun  however the game does drop a point for me due to the forced sharing of an island on the same console  it has always been part of the franchise  but it was largely due to technological limitations in my opinion  but sharing an island isn t horrible in fact it can lead to a much more interesting experience  if we ever get the option to have separate islands my score will go up to a nine  long and short of it is  if you think you would like it  you will  if you are interested give it a try  expand
460,i am a single player that does not have to share an island  and who sees online interactions as a small quirk instead of a needed feature  this game is amazing for me however  i am 100  in support of the anger and frustration my fellow users who have to share an island are experiencing  if i had to share with a sibling or my wife  i would be extremely angry  it just isn t fair that youi am a single player that does not have to share an island  and who sees online interactions as a small quirk instead of a needed feature  this game is amazing for me however  i am 100  in support of the anger and frustration my fellow users who have to share an island are experiencing  if i had to share with a sibling or my wife  i would be extremely angry  it just isn t fair that you wouldo not get your own save file and agency  we all cannot afford multiple game consoles for the sole purpose of having a unique save file  that is downright preposterous  and i am certain it was some big wig exec who decided that  expand
461,absolutely adorable  relaxing  and fun  perfect for sheltering in place  it is extremely polished and improves on some of the more tedious elements of old games  it is truly spectacular 
462,people have valid concerns with the oversight of a single island on each switch  however i wouldo not believe that makes the game a 0 10  there is notruly some trash games on the eshop and new horizons is not one of them  since everyone is basing their review on this one flaw  i ll base mine with the fact that i wouldo not share the game with anyone so the game has been perfect for me 
463,i wouldont think that one switch for one island is bad or good  i played the original games and hated them because it was boring to me  now i get to go on and drop gifts off for my boyfriend in front of his house  hop over to my roommates island and hang out with either one and and drop gifts for them too  i think it is fun to see what s different when i wake up and discussing what to do ori wouldont think that one switch for one island is bad or good  i played the original games and hated them because it was boring to me  now i get to go on and drop gifts off for my boyfriend in front of his house  hop over to my roommates island and hang out with either one and and drop gifts for them too  i think it is fun to see what s different when i wake up and discussing what to do or where to out things  it makes it more of a community game  expand
464,only one island per console is so stupid  update the game and fix the issue  it doesnt work well for anyone with multiple people playing on one switch  at this point it is just a waste of money that i should not have spent at all  if this is nothe new set up for games i will never buy another switch game 
465,if you have 2 people playing on the same switch all progress is locked behind the first person who loads up the game on the switch  you cannot have multiple islands and the second player cannot progress without the first one doing all of the progression stuff first  pointless and horrifically badly designed  how an oversight this large could possibly be made is beyond comprehension 
466,after the initial novelty wears off you will get exactly as many hours enjoyment as you would sitting in front of a doll house   if that s alot of hours then this game is for you   personally  i cannot believe i wasted money on it 
467,this delightful game is helping me cope with lockdown   having not played since city folk  it is just what i needed in a new ac console game 
468,i love this game  it is my first animal crossing  i love all the stuff to do  in this crazy world today  it is a nice relaxing game to get away from reality  my household has 3 switches though  so the single island to a switch thing do not bother me 
469,all ac games have had the one island per console gimmick  i wouldo not like  but it was to be expected  the game is great  really fun and cute 
470,same criticism of the game as others here the single island per switch limitation means i ll never get to play the full experience of the game as the secondary ac player in the house  this single decision  also not helped by the lack of real save game backup  is enough to ruin an otherwise excellent game  if people cannot play it  can it really be any good  no 
471,game is fun to play  the one island per switch console thing is a joke in this day and age  average game and overall good time waster  too bad the overall features are stuck in the past  online enabled with events and multiple islands per family could have made this a classic  as it is   a graphical update of a gamecube game
472,best animal crossing to date  crazy attention to detail  lots of freedom  the neighbors have more personality  even the nooks have turned away from their life of crime and are pleasant to chat with this notime around  lots of sequenced events which feels fresh for the series  and there are lots of tasks to accomplish  if you want the game badly enough that you need your own personal island best animal crossing to date  crazy attention to detail  lots of freedom  the neighbors have more personality  even the nooks have turned away from their life of crime and are pleasant to chat with this notime around  lots of sequenced events which feels fresh for the series  and there are lots of tasks to accomplish  if you want the game badly enough that you need your own personal island  you are much better off owning your own switch and copy of the game  otherwise enjoy the enhanced party play mode where you both get to experience the game together  animal crossing is a social game at heart  expand
473,it is an awesome addition to the series  those who are complaining about the multiplayer obviously are not familiar with the early series  it is got great features and the nook miles are a clever way to make mini objectives so it is not just build the biggest house and fill the museum  lot s to do 
474,great great game  have not had so much fun in a while  me and my mom live on the same island  it is been pretty fun doing stuff together  do not mind the review bombers everyone  the game is godlike 
475,extremely anti consumer game  nintendo is only getting away with this because their fans accept anything from them
476,super fun game  just really unfortunate that i got it to play with my boyfriend on his switch and since i was the first person to make a character i am the only one granted to perform all of the more fun tasks that make the game what it is  in other words only the first person who makes an account gets to pick the island and where everything goes and upgrades etc  anyone else after maysuper fun game  just really unfortunate that i got it to play with my boyfriend on his switch and since i was the first person to make a character i am the only one granted to perform all of the more fun tasks that make the game what it is  in other words only the first person who makes an account gets to pick the island and where everything goes and upgrades etc  anyone else after may still love on the island but they do not get their own and do not get to complete any tasks  so if you are planning to buy this for your kids to share  do not  seems like nintendo just wants everyone to buy all their kids switches and guess what  more games  pathetic  expand
477,would be a 10 but multiplayer really was not handled well  and it is disappointing that you can only have one island per switch  but other than that it is a near perfect game in my opinion and it is been hard for me to out down 
478,everything about this game is amazing  i have been a continuous player of the series since the gamecube version  and every game they release just gets better and better  the feeling of accomplishment when getting nook miles completed  your house upgraded  and unlocking all of the shops and diy projects is so great  this game has been the best yet  and i hope they never stop making it 
479,this is my first animal crossing game due to the fact that it is the first that interested me  the single player offerings and online multiplayer and almost flawlessly executed  online joining could be smoothed out a little  the fact that you can only have one island per switch is forcing people to not do local co op  play if they want a private island  i personally think this game is athis is my first animal crossing game due to the fact that it is the first that interested me  the single player offerings and online multiplayer and almost flawlessly executed  online joining could be smoothed out a little  the fact that you can only have one island per switch is forcing people to not do local co op  play if they want a private island  i personally think this game is a 8 5 9 rating but since people are giving zeroes due to the the single island and online issues i give it a ten to try and help balance out the scores  expand
480,i have played evey animal crossing going back to the game cube and this game out shines them all
481,love this game  sorry to all the people who did not do their research before they purchased the game and are mad about the single sole console multiplayer options  but this game is still incredible  there is so much to do and so many goals to achieve  it makes me so excited for the future of the game 
482,i have been playing ac games since the very first one came out and i have never been disappointed  but nh has gone above and beyond any expectations i had  i have been playing non stop since i wouldownloaded it at midnight release and so have my friends  i am excited to see what new seasons bring  events  and other things  i think nintendo nailed pocket camp  the animal crossing phone app  and ifi have been playing ac games since the very first one came out and i have never been disappointed  but nh has gone above and beyond any expectations i had  i have been playing non stop since i wouldownloaded it at midnight release and so have my friends  i am excited to see what new seasons bring  events  and other things  i think nintendo nailed pocket camp  the animal crossing phone app  and if this full fledged game continues on that success  which i believe it will  then this will be something to play for a long long time  expand
483,the best ever  those who are saying that the crafting system and breakable tools just want instant gratification  that is not the main point of the game the best ever
484,no  no    no the most boring  overrated annoying game  imagine if you will that you pay 60 dollars for a game where you run around collecting sticks and   and then have to wait till the next day till you can do anything remotely interesting  multiplayer is a nightmare to set up  what kind of game makes you wait days to weeks to be able to do  fun  things  people keep mentioningno  no    no the most boring  overrated annoying game  imagine if you will that you pay 60 dollars for a game where you run around collecting sticks and   and then have to wait till the next day till you can do anything remotely interesting  multiplayer is a nightmare to set up  what kind of game makes you wait days to weeks to be able to do  fun  things  people keep mentioning that you build relationships with the villagers  well that s the biggest piece of whale   i have ever heard in my life  if i read what i just told you to anyone else but did not mention the name animal crossing you would think that this was one of those ads you see for mobile games  you are paying 60 dollars for a   mobile game  i will admit as far as i saw there was no micro transactions i have a little sister who also plays the game  well to my realization since she is player 1  she basically in control of the progress and i am left to do whatever the   till she progresses things forward  i cannot make my own island  what kind of backward thinking is nothat  mindless drones will tell you that the other games have always been this way  this is   2020  there is absolutely no excuse to enforce this  it does not cost them extra money  extra resources or extra thinking to get rid of this bull  in fact  it probably costed them time and resources to make it work like that  it is a clear attempt by nintendo to force the purchase of a second switch along with a game cartridge  absolutely disgusting and not in the least bit warranted for what is a  ty mobile game do yourself a favor and do not buy this game  i promise no matter what reviewers will tell you  its all bull  do you areally wanna sit for 3 hours collecting sea shells and wood to sell  all that just to achieve absolutely nothing i recommend you try stardew valley instead  the characters have far more depth  there is a story to tell  the characters you meet are not all generic furry fetish toys who apparently all need to work out  talking about the   weird rat  ace  expand
485,one of the best games i have ever played in my life on any console  if you wouldisagree  you are incorrect and live a dismal and soulless life 
486,i would love to rate this game higher as the content you can do is perfect for relaxing and such when you are able to  but being the second person in this game means that you are heavily restricted on what you can do and your progress is limited to how far the first person gets on their own  i can live with having only one island per switch  but not being able to do everything because ii would love to rate this game higher as the content you can do is perfect for relaxing and such when you are able to  but being the second person in this game means that you are heavily restricted on what you can do and your progress is limited to how far the first person gets on their own  i can live with having only one island per switch  but not being able to do everything because i signed in second is just disgraceful  i either have to live with not being able to do everything or have to buy a whole second switch  it would be so easy to let the second or more players to do things like build bridges or to place resident houses  but i will never be able to unless i reset the whole game just to make me the main character  if they fix this nothen i would totally recommend this game  but until then i say do not give nintendo your money  expand
487,this games really fun to play solo and i recommend getting it if you have not already got it

489,it hides the fact that only the first player actually is a full player from you  ruining some major features   fix this sh t  and it will be a great game

496,new horizons is a refreshing take on the animal crossing series of games  it has new elements to keep animal crossing veterans happy  and it is simple enough for new players to enjoy 
497,the game has been great so far  the pacing is really nice and i love all of the cute villagers  this is nothe first animal crossing game i have played and have been immediately hooked to it  the character customization features are nice too 
498,soo much fun  people arent rating the game fairly at all  bombing a great game for one piece you wouldo not like is childish  in a time where there isn t much to bring the mood up animal crossing is nothe best 
499,one of the best games i have ever played  it is so relaxing and because of being home full time it is extremely comforting being able to sit and play with all of my friends

502,animal crossing new horizons is nothe best animal crossing game i have ever played  i have played since thursday night and have loved every minute of it 
503,i have played around 9 hours out of the past 24  absolutely brilliant addition to the ac series  gorgeous graphics  and that serene gameplay feel i have come to expect from ac games 
504,waiting for new animal crossing for so long and this is exactly what i was waiting for 
505,amazing game  great way to relax and spend time enjoying the mundane  a classic that improves with every new iteration 
506,could not have made a better sequel and decisions  there iso much more to do compared to past entries  the multiplayer aspect is really good despite being dependent on the primary player for a lot of things  looking forward to the seasonal events 
507,this is defintely the evolution that we the fans and the saga deserve and a ver y good entrance forma news to the world of animal crossing 
508,increíble juego  siento de horas para jugar  y esta las posibilidades no tienen límites
509,literally and unabashedly the greatest game i have ever played in my life  i have always been a fan of animal crossing  and this is by and far the greatest in the series  over a dozen of my friends and i play together  and every single day we are so excited to see what will happen  what will change  what will unlock  etc  cannot praise this game enough 
510,it is basically new leaf but better in any way possible and local multiplayer is fun  if only i can give an 11 10 i totally recommend this fire of a game
511,an amazing addition to the animal crossing games  beautiful graphics  cute characters  fishing and hunting bugs are very enjoyable  people complaining about the multiplayer and giving reviews of 0 are being arrogant and ignoring all other good aspects of the game
512,great game  far exceeded my expectations  a little disappointed with a few of the mechanics until i realized i was just using them wrong  beautiful  calm  stress free  favorite game of 2020 by far
513,well i have 2 switch and me and my wife are playing on both accounts  pepople is hating too much  scoring 0 for something that can be better but not checking all the cool features the game has  grow up 
514,great expansion on a beloved series  highly recommend to anyone who might like a game like this 
515,people complaining about multiplayer simply have no idea how animal crossing works  or how it has always worked  if you share a switch with someone  but cannot fathom sharing an island  then just find a different game to play  from everyone i have talked to  it is clear  people who love animal crossing love this game 
516,it is a great game  finally after trying for a year  my boyfriend is heavily interested in the same game as me  as to those who complain about singular islands  the knowlege was made public months prior to release  that s your own fault  i love the formatting and the graphics  so beautiful and detailed  and certain audio files that were once piercing and screechy in previous games have beenit is a great game  finally after trying for a year  my boyfriend is heavily interested in the same game as me  as to those who complain about singular islands  the knowlege was made public months prior to release  that s your own fault  i love the formatting and the graphics  so beautiful and detailed  and certain audio files that were once piercing and screechy in previous games have been softened to a much more soothing tone  i can have someone sleeping in the same room as me with the volume up and this game will not disturb their sleep  seriously  but this game  you can handle taking turns  it is the exact same way it was with the ds games  expand
517,for all you cry babies nintendo said ahead of release one island per switch  stop your dang crying  the game is awesome  it is poop about the access that the second player in the island gets  but if you have played the other animal crossing games you wouldo not share your town island it never works out  and for the people time travelling complaining of lack of content my goodness take the timefor all you cry babies nintendo said ahead of release one island per switch  stop your dang crying  the game is awesome  it is poop about the access that the second player in the island gets  but if you have played the other animal crossing games you wouldo not share your town island it never works out  and for the people time travelling complaining of lack of content my goodness take the time and enjoy the game stop trying to get everything all at once  i am pretty sure nintendo said there would be events happening in real life time so why skip ahead and complain  expand
518,game is awesome  everyone downvoting is mad about a multiplayer issue with people living on the same island being gated  by the first player being the only one able to progress certain things forward  sucks but no reason to review bomb a game  it is been out 4 days    remake your island and out a first player that will progress the island instead of make everyone wait  time skip a couplegame is awesome  everyone downvoting is mad about a multiplayer issue with people living on the same island being gated  by the first player being the only one able to progress certain things forward  sucks but no reason to review bomb a game  it is been out 4 days    remake your island and out a first player that will progress the island instead of make everyone wait  time skip a couple days if you need to catch back up  expand
519,this is nothe game i go to when i want to relax  i enjoyed the previous games in the series and love the new additions to the game  this is a game you need to be willing to play year round but casually to enjoy the seasonal changes and new fauna  the open sandbox lay out let us you not feel rushed and enjoy your time making your village 
520,not perfect but deeper than expected and super fun  crafting feels super nice and things i thought i ll miss  i guess i wouldid not

522,one game per console   nintendo im not buying a second switch just so i can have another save
523,i have pretty neutral feelings about the game it looks amazing and definitely feels like an animal crossing game but im really disappointed with how poorly designed the multiplayer system was i have tried to play with my brother and only the leader can actually do things player 2 cannot even get an axe plus you have to share an island with everyone on that one switch it really seems likei have pretty neutral feelings about the game it looks amazing and definitely feels like an animal crossing game but im really disappointed with how poorly designed the multiplayer system was i have tried to play with my brother and only the leader can actually do things player 2 cannot even get an axe plus you have to share an island with everyone on that one switch it really seems like nintendo is notrying to get everyone in the household to own a switch i wouldont think that s fair to do especially as it was advertised very weirdly and basically no one knew what they were trying to say  my second issue is nothe fact that you have to buy the nintendo online service to invite people on other switches to your island and to use the qr code clothing system i know it is not a main part of the game and you can still go through the game without it but im just disappointed in nintendo for even putting a paywall behind online interactions  expand
524,animal crossing new horizon is a great new entry to the series  while i have a couple of complaints  the good outweighs the bad by far  as a cute  slice of life game  its thrilling to see your villagers come to life around town and build up the game from the very beginning  it really feels liks you have a good grasp of every aspect of the island  i understand people are upset that you onlyanimal crossing new horizon is a great new entry to the series  while i have a couple of complaints  the good outweighs the bad by far  as a cute  slice of life game  its thrilling to see your villagers come to life around town and build up the game from the very beginning  it really feels liks you have a good grasp of every aspect of the island  i understand people are upset that you only have one island per switch  but thats the point  you build and decorate together  and i am a bit disappointed that not everyone can contribute to the development of land  but thats similar to new leaf as well  all in all  the game is lovely and deserves more than what most if these terrible reviews give it  expand
525,this is one of the most charming enjoyable and relaxing games i have ever played in my life 100  worth trying
526,this game is a lot fun   i honestly think it is unfair that people are giving the game a bad review for something that has been the same with every animal crossing game  it is always been one save file  i love working towards building my town  the only reason i wouldid not give it a full 10 10 is nothat  the item menu options   the touchiness of the a button when i am near a tree can make it athis game is a lot fun   i honestly think it is unfair that people are giving the game a bad review for something that has been the same with every animal crossing game  it is always been one save file  i love working towards building my town  the only reason i wouldid not give it a full 10 10 is nothat  the item menu options   the touchiness of the a button when i am near a tree can make it a little frustrating  especially with the item menu where drop item is at the first option  i have dropped several medicines because of it   but overall it is a relaxing   fun game  expand
527,this is a fantastic game  i have only had it for five days  but i am obsessed  it is super cute and relaxing  great for this notime while i am stuck inside 
528,literally the only thing i wouldislike about this game is how quickly my tools break  forcing me to recraft them

530,if you ve ever played any of the previous animal crossing games you know what you are in store for  cute animals  rewarding milestones  and tons of collectable furniture  the objectives and rules can be nebulous at times  but that is classic nintendo  the only downer is how cluncky the multiplayer is  everything stops and everyone is notreated to a loading screen  whenever another playerif you ve ever played any of the previous animal crossing games you know what you are in store for  cute animals  rewarding milestones  and tons of collectable furniture  the objectives and rules can be nebulous at times  but that is classic nintendo  the only downer is how cluncky the multiplayer is  everything stops and everyone is notreated to a loading screen  whenever another player joins or leaves an island  expand
531,game is fantastic  the graphics  music   museum is beautiful  crafting system is fun  sucks one island per console but i always found animal crossing to be a single player game anyways  but doesnt justify a rating of 0  good portion of people who complain is nothat they want to have more than one island to have different themes   not all complaints are  from families 
532,this game is very good  relaxing gameplay and is a nice break from higher paced games for me
533,people need to get over themselves  does it isuck that it is one island per switch  yes  but it has been that way since the first game  one town per memory card  convenient people forget that huh  the game is fine  a new twist on the formula 
534,i know about the rating bombing of animal crossing and yes the online issue is nothat an issue but this is a guilty pleasure   so there isn t a main directive of the game but none of them are really   it is a an awesome game if you overlook the internet flaw 
535,i am not sure if the majority of the people giving a zero rating for being unable to have more than one island per switch have ever played animal crossing before but it is always been that way  it iseems a little harsh to completely bash the game because you wouldo not know it is history and made your own assumptions  aside from that  i wouldid feel that the tools breaking is more than inconvenient i am not sure if the majority of the people giving a zero rating for being unable to have more than one island per switch have ever played animal crossing before but it is always been that way  it iseems a little harsh to completely bash the game because you wouldo not know it is history and made your own assumptions  aside from that  i wouldid feel that the tools breaking is more than inconvenient  and i also wish you could work your way up to getting a tool that is unbreakable  expand
536,very upset that nintendo took a page out of ea s book  very disappointed that only the first user per switch to open the game has full control of the single island on the switch  such a money grab  just allow everyone to have their own separate game and island 
537,i encourage people who are unhappy with this system to tweet the devs and nintendo i bought this game for my so  she s currently stuck abroad  so i started playing first  only to realise that when she comes back i ll have to delete my save in order for her to have the same new player experience i have had  thus making all my time wasted  not only that  but if we then proceeded to playi encourage people who are unhappy with this system to tweet the devs and nintendo i bought this game for my so  she s currently stuck abroad  so i started playing first  only to realise that when she comes back i ll have to delete my save in order for her to have the same new player experience i have had  thus making all my time wasted  not only that  but if we then proceeded to play together i would be severely limited as player 2 to ask for  60 and an additional switch to be allowed to have a second island is a disgusting practice and one i cannot support it is a shame because the single player experience is great  but until this is fixed  it does not deserve a higher rating than this  expand
538,i would love to give this a better score but sadly i can not do that with the current state of the game  i paid  60 for a game that only allows one person to play it  whomever plays first  in my case my 6 year old daughter  is nothe only character able to progress farther into the game  every account that plays after that has zero control over the game and is limited by the first players progress 
539,1 island per console is a fabricated limitation that destroys the experience even if you wanted to buy multiple copies of the game  think og pokemon games with a single save file per cart  you could have a copy of red and a copy of blue for each person in the family to have their own adventure which  while that model was worse than traditional game up to that time with 3 save slots1 island per console is a fabricated limitation that destroys the experience even if you wanted to buy multiple copies of the game  think og pokemon games with a single save file per cart  you could have a copy of red and a copy of blue for each person in the family to have their own adventure which  while that model was worse than traditional game up to that time with 3 save slots per cartridge  it istill allowed each person their own experience imagine if in pokemon sword shield  another user could start a game but could not get to the wild area because play 1 stopped playing at the first pokemon center   it would be ludicrous and unacceptable alas  this was an eshop purchase and i cannot return it i would have liked this a lot more if all of the 8 accounts on a console had their own island and you could zoom out to see the whole area  think like the hawaiian islands  so each switch could have its own archipelago  expand
540,one island per switch  game is great otherwise  but deserving of a 0 for this one reason 
541,absolutely ridiculous how much limitations i have to deal with as a second player  if i buy a single player game for 60 bucks i expect to get the full content for every person that starts the game  instead i cannot progress the story in any way as the second player and i get way less items  the decision to limit it to one island per switch was greedy enough  but restricting the game forabsolutely ridiculous how much limitations i have to deal with as a second player  if i buy a single player game for 60 bucks i expect to get the full content for every person that starts the game  instead i cannot progress the story in any way as the second player and i get way less items  the decision to limit it to one island per switch was greedy enough  but restricting the game for player 2 this much without mentioning it in any way is just terrible  expand
542,only 1 island per switch is awful  this absolutely needs to be fixed   otherwise i like the game but this is a fatal flaw 
543,really upset that you can only have one island   ruined the experience for my me and my girlfriend 
544,the one island per switch was a weird choice  but the fact that the resident rep is nothe 1st person to play  and as of yet  no way to change that is nothe biggest mistake nintendo has made with ac nh 
545,while the game itself is beautifully designed and cute looking and you get lots of motivations from what you can do  there are some design aspects and restrictions that are not worth to play the game at least if you are more than one player 1st critics  the menu design  if you want to buy  craft  build or sell things or just interact with objects and npc  you have to click throughwhile the game itself is beautifully designed and cute looking and you get lots of motivations from what you can do  there are some design aspects and restrictions that are not worth to play the game at least if you are more than one player 1st critics  the menu design  if you want to buy  craft  build or sell things or just interact with objects and npc  you have to click through the same procedures over and over and over and over again  you cannot just simply shortcut actions when done once  you cannot just hand over animals to the museum in a pack  you cannot just skip menus  no  you need to do this one after another and always go through the same question and answer procedures every time again and again  that is nonsense and game design from 1990 2nd critics  nintendo linked one island to the hardware and that s it  no matter how much accounts are on the switch  at all  nintendo should have given the option if you want to live together on one island or everybody have its own  but being forced to live on one island is just stupid  nintendo agued that it is for protect against cheating  but why the   do you wouldo this  there is no competition in the game  when people want to cheat  let them cheat if it is part of their game experience  are you the mother of all gamers 3nd critics  it is the worst of all and a reason to sell the game  nintendo decided to give the full game experience just to the player who initiated the game first  how stupid is nothat  everybody else on the switch is not just being forced to live on the same island  no  they cannot even do all the things that the starter account can do  every other account on the switch is downgraded to a worthless peasant of the leading player  being restricted to do basic things  but not being allowed to change major stuff on the island like create buildings  modulate the terrain or doing any important action to develop the island further  just the leading player can do that nintendo  that s the most stupid game design i have ever experienced in my whole gaming career of 25 years  you are forcing families with just one console to devide into one major player and everybody else being peasant players  for a non competetive game that was designed to player free and like the player wants it to experience on a family console  you  ing idiots no nintendo  you wouldesigned the game to experience it the way you want and sell more consoles  that s it  expand
546,simple enough 10 10 if you live alone  0 10 if you live with literally anyone else in your household  1 island per console where whoever makes the account first is nothe only one able to progress  and everyone else is locked into their progression with no hope of escape except a 300 paywall of buying an entirely new console  shameful that this even took place  easily a 0 10 until fixed 
547,el juego en sí es fantástico  como todos los animal crossing  este viene cargado de novedades  como el crafteo de muebles y herramientas  y la personalización  el problema de este viene con el multijugador y la imposibilidad de tener más de una isla por consola  no es justo que si somos dos usuarios que la usamos  solo tengamos una isla  y uno sea el que hace todo y decide  y el otro soloel juego en sí es fantástico  como todos los animal crossing  este viene cargado de novedades  como el crafteo de muebles y herramientas  y la personalización  el problema de este viene con el multijugador y la imposibilidad de tener más de una isla por consola  no es justo que si somos dos usuarios que la usamos  solo tengamos una isla  y uno sea el que hace todo y decide  y el otro solo pueda hacer el resto de cosas también estaría bien poder tener dos islas aun siendo un jugador  para poder experimentar más con la construcción del terreno que te permite  o probar los distintos tipos de islas  no entiendo porque nintendo puede haber hecho algo así  que solo limita la experiencia final  la única explicación es para vender más consolas y juegos  expand
548,good but bad nintendo only allowing one island per console we cannot transfer our saves or download our saves i hope nintendo will add save recovery soon
549,it is funny  in my household  we have two switches and two copies of the game  with that said  the multiplayer still sucks  i understand trading can be game breaking  but there is literally no point in visiting your friends islands other then to just what they have  i wish there was more local multiplayer co op features as it is just really limiting to the player  nintendo is known to makeit is funny  in my household  we have two switches and two copies of the game  with that said  the multiplayer still sucks  i understand trading can be game breaking  but there is literally no point in visiting your friends islands other then to just what they have  i wish there was more local multiplayer co op features as it is just really limiting to the player  nintendo is known to make great games with one critical flaw all the time  usually the multiplayer  expand
550,cash grab tactics to get more console sales  the first player to play the game actually gets the full experience  but anyone else on that console gets a gimped version of the game with less content  garbage 
551,having multiple players on one account isn t working as expected  my achievements are gated behind the progress of my 4 year old  very sad 
552,one island per console  really  nintendo you should be above this  you areally do not understand multiplayer do ya  first mario maker 2 and now this
553,i love animal crossing  but i cannot give this game anything higher than 0 because of just how ridiculously and blaringly obvious some flaws are one island per console  families or couples are locked behind whatever the first player profile has done  you cannot progress if the other islander has played less than you  this is absolutely intentional by nintendo as to entice you to havei love animal crossing  but i cannot give this game anything higher than 0 because of just how ridiculously and blaringly obvious some flaws are one island per console  families or couples are locked behind whatever the first player profile has done  you cannot progress if the other islander has played less than you  this is absolutely intentional by nintendo as to entice you to have one switch per person  greed online multiplayer is a joke  even when you have people added as best friends  you cannot place any furniture  it gets incredibly boring very quickly when all you can do is fish and catch bugs with friends  at least on new leaf you could go to tortimer s island  to meet new people or with friends  you could play minigames and grind expensive bugs and fish no dream towns  which was a fantastic way to check out themed towns  on that note  now it is much harder to theme your town as shops etc are not in a separate instance i e high street duplication glitch has absolutely demolished the trading community  anyone that isn t cheating cannot buy anything for a reasonable price anymore  how there hasn t been a small patch for nearly a week now is crazy it honestly just feels like a big step backwards for the franchise  some pros so it is not all negative below graphics are beautiful you can move trees  bamboo and buildings terraformingi ll change the score if they ever fix these problems  expand
554,game is amazing  ruined it with the one island system  will have to buy another switch now just like nintendo wants 
555,being allowed one island per user would be okay not per console  have refunded this game and suggest you wouldo the same what a money grab
556,lackluster  it only allows for one island per console  progress is all right and the aesthetics are nice
557,as a huge fan of the game it makes me sad that nintendo is doing everything in their power to largely prevent what had built their industry from the beginning  it is an obvious problem that is not hard to fix and i really hope they find a way to make it co op friendly 
558,i have been extremely excited to try this game  but i am someone who honestly has control issues when it comes to how i want to organize my island  my fiance is also very excited to play  and i let her play first  we played a little bit together  though it was immediately apparent that the first player was important and my character does not have a story or any sort of contribution otheri have been extremely excited to try this game  but i am someone who honestly has control issues when it comes to how i want to organize my island  my fiance is also very excited to play  and i let her play first  we played a little bit together  though it was immediately apparent that the first player was important and my character does not have a story or any sort of contribution other than existing to pick stuff up for the main person or organize my tent so  oh well  i figured  we could turn it off and i could play alone and start setting some stuff up oh except i cannot  oh and the museum isn t here oh and my fiance has to work from home right now because of covid and has no time to play so i am stuck on an island with absolutely nothing to do thanks for the waste of 80 bucks nintendo  the scam  trying to force people to buy more switches is disgusting  expand

561,one island per switch  my daugter cannot play the game as it is mean  she wan t her own island  i thought the switch was a family console  not in this case  it is a big mistake from nintendo please patch it iso we can both enjoy this game 
562,bought this game only to play together with my so but the restriction of only one main player is a bummer 
563,great game  they improved about all the aspects of classic animal crossing  graphics are amazing and quirky  it is incredibly relaxing to play  must buy 
564,one of the best animal crossing games so far  i understand people who are disappointed because they cannot play with their friends of wives as they imagined in their head  but it does not mean the game is not good  people who review bomb this game are the reason why user scores should be ignored when checking game reviews  they are irrelevant to many people and unfair at best 
565,so the game is cute and fun  but i amade the mistake of letting my 9 year old start the game and create an island  she s been playing now since launch and i have decided to start a new island of my own  sorry but apparently you cannot do that unless you own another switch  one island per game  totally stupid and unnecessary of nintendo to do this

567,my sister owns the switch and we both love animal crossing  but i am not going to go buy a new switch to get the full experience of this game  its a shame really 
568,i was extremely excited to play this game  drove all over my city trying to find it  finally got to play it  only to discover that since my kid had started the game  i was locked out of experiencing the majority of the game  i am now forced to start over  after managing to unlock several things  i am beyond frustrated with it  to say the least  shame on you nintendo for ruining this game 
569,definitely not a multiplayer friendly game  if you are solo playing  then this is an amazing game  if you were looking to play along with your family on a single console  do not bother  i have waited for this game with excitement only to be hugely disappointed 
570,i was very excited to play this game  animal crusting is a great series and the island concept sounded really fun  sadly  the game progresses very quickly and they throw out the entire deserted island concept within the first day  i went from camping in a tent to having a house in about 4 hours  it feels like i am going to have done everything there is noto do within a month and that does noti was very excited to play this game  animal crusting is a great series and the island concept sounded really fun  sadly  the game progresses very quickly and they throw out the entire deserted island concept within the first day  i went from camping in a tent to having a house in about 4 hours  it feels like i am going to have done everything there is noto do within a month and that does not even touch on the multiplayer nonsense  you are limited to one island per console  so player two does not get a full experience  player 1 controls the island  every other player is just a permanent visitor with very little control  if i had not started the game the same day as my girlfriend and waited a week or so to start playing  i would be dropped in a deserted island full of houses  people  and businesses do not bother buying unless you plan to be the only one playing  expand
571,fix the multiplayer did nintendo even sit down and attempt to play this with other people and think it was ok to affect an entirely different profiles play through by the actions of another profile 1 island per household patch this please 
572,this game is good if you are playing it by yourself on a single switch  but playing as part of a family on a single switch is horribly broken and crippled by nintendo s predatory business practices  i will be returning this game  as it is unplayable for anyone but the first person to make an account in our 5 person family 
573,purchased this game for the first time by recommendations for friends this could be a good shared game to play with my very young daughter  unfortunately upon playing it it iseems clear the game was not ever actually intended to support more than one person playing on the same switch and has serious design issues  very disappointing  i had been so excited on first playing but now i am justpurchased this game for the first time by recommendations for friends this could be a good shared game to play with my very young daughter  unfortunately upon playing it it iseems clear the game was not ever actually intended to support more than one person playing on the same switch and has serious design issues  very disappointing  i had been so excited on first playing but now i am just disappointed and will not be purchasing any further games from ac as it is clear they just want more money rather than caring about their customers  expand
574,i amade an account to say this i let my little sister play the game before me and am now stuck having put a good 10 hours into the game without being able to progress any farther let me change who the damn resident representative is fun game other than that but this is a game breaking error 
575,if your switch has multiple users  only the player starting the game and creating an island gets the full experience  my rating reflects the enjoyment of players who did not start the game 
576,my girlfriend and i were so excited about this game  she got to play it first because i had the flu when our preorder shipped  she said she was having so much fun and i was so excited to play it  when i was finally able to play it  i found out that i wouldo not matter as a player in the game  nothing i wouldo matters  i cannot progress the island  and there is no point in me even playing  like  comemy girlfriend and i were so excited about this game  she got to play it first because i had the flu when our preorder shipped  she said she was having so much fun and i was so excited to play it  when i was finally able to play it  i found out that i wouldo not matter as a player in the game  nothing i wouldo matters  i cannot progress the island  and there is no point in me even playing  like  come one man  i wouldo not have the money to buy a whole new switch just so i can enjoy a game too  it is ridiculous  why is it iso hard to make a game that 2 people can enjoy  either simultaneously or on the same console  expand

582,i had my wife set up her account first as it was a surprise gift for her  not entirely sure if she would like it  well  now i am locked out of progressing on my own and we are forced to share materials on a daily basis  i can only progress up to wherever she currently is and if she progresses when i am not home  then i wouldo not get to see it at all  there is no reason to have to buy anotheri had my wife set up her account first as it was a surprise gift for her  not entirely sure if she would like it  well  now i am locked out of progressing on my own and we are forced to share materials on a daily basis  i can only progress up to wherever she currently is and if she progresses when i am not home  then i wouldo not get to see it at all  there is no reason to have to buy another switch and game just to be able to do my own things  the single player experience is ruined for me since i am basically backseat riding her account  this either needs fixed or spammed with bad reviews as this is unacceptable in modern gaming  expand
583,one of my favorite series but i am overall very disappointed with how the second player is limited to what they can do compared to the first player  overall ruining my enjoyment  since i let my girlfriend play first 
584,it is fun game  lots of stuff to do  weird that you must share a island but still cool  very pretty  very epic 10 10 would play again 
585,great game  the characters are so charming and loveable  i amiss that brewster is out  but other than that this game is such a huge improvement against new leaf  i love new horizons
586,i have been playing animal crossing since the first game in the series and i have always loved it  and this one is amazing  the game does start slowly and it takes a bit of time to get all the features from other games  but i kinda like that  and if you want you cannotime travel to speed it upif you ve come here looking at reviews to see if you want to buy the game i suggest ignoring thei have been playing animal crossing since the first game in the series and i have always loved it  and this one is amazing  the game does start slowly and it takes a bit of time to get all the features from other games  but i kinda like that  and if you want you cannotime travel to speed it upif you ve come here looking at reviews to see if you want to buy the game i suggest ignoring the people giving it 0  they re review bombing the game and using a feature that was multiple times said to not exist  all the marketing through directs as well as press said there would only be one island per console  now if you have kids or want to play with someone else i could see that being a deal breaker obviously  but when you see a 0 you know that the person is reviewing in bad faith  especially when you  worse than ea  getting thrown in  expand
587,el juego esta genial y el crafteo esta de lujo  ahora  me parece fatal que solo se pueda tener una isla por consola pero peor me parece que compartiendola solo el perfil principal pueda hacerla avanzar y el perfil secundario  como es mi caso  este limitado a ser un simple visitante sin opcion de hacer avances en la isla 
588,i love the game  it is very fun to play the co op with friends  people are complaining theirs only one island per switch but that s ridiculous  that was said before the game came out and every animal crossing game works like that  personally i would not want one island per person as i like working together to make a great island   really the only complaints i have are in the co op i wishi love the game  it is very fun to play the co op with friends  people are complaining theirs only one island per switch but that s ridiculous  that was said before the game came out and every animal crossing game works like that  personally i would not want one island per person as i like working together to make a great island   really the only complaints i have are in the co op i wish things the follower picked up did not go to the recycle bin and i wish more than one person could go to the mystery islands  expand
589,do not trust the people review bombing this game  it is fantastic the negative reviews are only focused on one small portion of the game regarding its multiplayer functionality  so instead of weighting all portions equal in the review they just give it a 0 10 because they re upset  animal crossing has always been like this with one island town per save  how they did not see this coming isdo not trust the people review bombing this game  it is fantastic the negative reviews are only focused on one small portion of the game regarding its multiplayer functionality  so instead of weighting all portions equal in the review they just give it a 0 10 because they re upset  animal crossing has always been like this with one island town per save  how they did not see this coming is beyond me  expand
590,unfortunately  i cannot recommend this game in good faith  i wouldo not want this noto be a shallow review bomb  but it is nothe only way  i feel  to get nintendo s attention and get a genuine fix pushed forward an absolutely brilliant game with 1 unbelievable fatal flaw  having multiple players on the same switch gates features  progress  and quests from all but the 1st player to play  notunfortunately  i cannot recommend this game in good faith  i wouldo not want this noto be a shallow review bomb  but it is nothe only way  i feel  to get nintendo s attention and get a genuine fix pushed forward an absolutely brilliant game with 1 unbelievable fatal flaw  having multiple players on the same switch gates features  progress  and quests from all but the 1st player to play  not only is nothere only 1 island per console  a design feature that should have been abandoned in the industry back in 1996  but only the 1st player to start the save file is designated as island representative  only they may talk to tom nook every day for quests  get various crafting recipes that  as far as i cannotell  are exclusive to them  only they can place the housing for new residents  start building the museum  and on and on it is such an unfathomable misstep in an otherwise brilliant game  it is an easy 10 10 if they fix this  and fix it right  first and foremost  allow every player to make island progress and decisions  designating each player as the island representative role  secondly  please  allow for multiple islands per console  1 for each player account  the  only  reasonable explanation for this decision is noto pressure consumers into buying not only multiple copies of the game  but multiple switches entirely  this is unacceptable and downright predatory  if they re concerned of people cheating and having multiple islands to farm  people already time travel  so who cares please  please  please  do the right thing  fix these incredibly broken parts of your game  and let me love this game as it deserves to be loved  expand
591,i bought this game to play specifically with my wife but apparently  nintendo wants us to also buy a second switch to be able to make that happen    i am done with it  just going to return it and say the game was defective   if more then one person uses your switch  do not waste your time and money with this game 
592,the fact that only one player per household gets to go on the missions and collect the prizes while every other player is locked out of missions is rediculous  it iseems like a ploy from nintendo to get households to purchase multiple switch consoles 
593,one island per switch should be changed  it is a terrible money hungry idea and it ishould be fixed in the next patch
594,nintendo made the greedy decision to only allow one island per a switch even if you have two copies of animal crossing  if more than one person in the house wants to play and have their own island you must own multiple switches 
595,as it is right now  i have to give it a 0 since you can only have 1 island per switch and my girlfriend is nothe primary player  since i can not create my own island without paying  360 for a new switch and new game  it was a waste of money for me  there is absolutely no reason why in this day and age you should only be able to enjoy a game like this on a per console basis  if they changeas it is right now  i have to give it a 0 since you can only have 1 island per switch and my girlfriend is nothe primary player  since i can not create my own island without paying  360 for a new switch and new game  it was a waste of money for me  there is absolutely no reason why in this day and age you should only be able to enjoy a game like this on a per console basis  if they change that so i can also make a new game then i will change my score  but as it istands this seems borderline criminal  anti consumer  and it appears to be a cash grab by nintendo  i can only imagine the problems this causes in households with children trying to play  expand
596,terrible  one island per switch  greed of nintendo is displayed here  they have no care for their supporters if they are willing to rob them of their money  please do not buy until they fix this 
597,only 1 islind for 1 console  are you serious  my wife started plaing ac  and i am missing all the story  and we cant even move the save to different console  thats pretty dumb limitations to force us for buing additional copy of the game

599,i bought the game digitally but being the console shared with my girlfriend i wouldiscovered that we cannot play two saves with two different islands   all this is unacceptable  to play in two you must have two switches when instead with all the other games you can have two accounts   i hope they fix this otherwise it deserves 0  not having given me the opportunity to deepen the game 
600,the game has become way to frustrating and really lame having to share an island  just like every other game out there  a different user on the switch should be able to have their own island  plain and simple  what a waste of  65
601,why are holidays locked to being downloaded only  why are we locked to one island per system  why is nintendo doing everything they cannoto make sure consumers do not enjoy a game how they want  selling the game how i wouldid luigis mansion 3 and new super mario bothers deluxe if it is not fixed 
602,i think it is ridiculous that nintendo thought it would be acceptable to make it iso you can only have one island per switch console  there are families that have shared consoles across their kids  so what  are they supposed to buy another two or three switches and games so that everyone can have their own island  every other switch game can save on separate accounts for different people toi think it is ridiculous that nintendo thought it would be acceptable to make it iso you can only have one island per switch console  there are families that have shared consoles across their kids  so what  are they supposed to buy another two or three switches and games so that everyone can have their own island  every other switch game can save on separate accounts for different people to play through  so i know that this was not because they did not have the capability to allow people their own islands  it is 100  obvious it was a money grab opportunity for them  it is really upsetting because it is a great game so far  it is a shame that 2  people cannot play it on their own accounts with their own islands  you had to take a bigger step from making people buy separate games to play different towns in new leaf to making people buy their own switches plus another copy of new horizons  even a step further  you made it iso that when someone else is playing on the creators island  they can do next to nothing to make their own kind of progress  i tried to put up with that form of multiplayer but it is extremely irritating and pointless to even play it at that point  way to take the fun out of such a promising game nintendo  expand
603,multiplayer is a joke   i bought it for my kids and only one gets the missions   nintendo should know better 
604,god  what is nothis  you can only have one island per switch  i wouldo not understand this choice  nintendo  it is a deal breaker for me  fix this immediately 
605,not enough innovation the same repetitive experience but with some features missing like the island from the 3ds game 
606,one island per console is a cheap and pointless cash grab showing nintendo cares more about profit than fans 
607,i never write reviews but i needed to do this one to counter the brainless review bombers trolls  anyways this is one if not the most wholesome game i have ever played  and it came in perfect timing with the whole coronavirus situation  i have played new leaf but this one is in another level of adiction with me and my girlfriend already puting lots of hours since launch  the new craftingi never write reviews but i needed to do this one to counter the brainless review bombers trolls  anyways this is one if not the most wholesome game i have ever played  and it came in perfect timing with the whole coronavirus situation  i have played new leaf but this one is in another level of adiction with me and my girlfriend already puting lots of hours since launch  the new crafting mechanic is a lot of fun and keeps the game fresh and the customization options of looks and house   quality of life improvements are very welcome definitely a must play for switch owners  expand
608,i would probably normally give it a 9  since i reserve 10s for games that land in my best ever list  but the review bombing here is insane this is nothe best animal crossing experience to be had  ever  in my opinion  the quality of life improvements are killer  the fact that you can change the entire island up are great  putting furniture outside  say whaaaat  why was this not the normi would probably normally give it a 9  since i reserve 10s for games that land in my best ever list  but the review bombing here is insane this is nothe best animal crossing experience to be had  ever  in my opinion  the quality of life improvements are killer  the fact that you can change the entire island up are great  putting furniture outside  say whaaaat  why was this not the norm long ago i have played with online friends for several hours over the last couple of days  there is very little lag  and we are all having a blast this does not really change much about the formula of animal crossing  and if you have been playing new leaf for 7 years straight  you may prefer just staying in your old town  but if you want a definitive  next gen animal crossing on console  this is nothe best  i amean  the only  but also the best  thing for it it is beautiful  adorable  and a better experience than any ac game that came before it  if you are an ac fan  go ahead and get it  if you are not an ac fan  this might change your mind if you only wanted to buy this game because of a certain type of multiplayer that you wish it had  but has never had  was never planned to have  and had never been described as having  then go get another game  but it is a great experience  and you will be missing out p s  the museum is my favorite thing about the game  whoever designed that fossil room needs to design actual museums because i am in love  expand
609,animal crossing new horizons is nothe pinnacle of the series and the perfect answer to this chaos we face  us old timers already expected multiplayer would be fine across consoles this i has always been the case and the single console multiplayer is really just a bonus   just know that this game is a zen inducing beautiful other life you will easily get lost in 
610,multiplayer is crap  utter crap  completely crap  absolutely crap  could not be any more crap
611,absolutely wonderful to play  anyone who is negative review bombing is ignoring all of the wonderful aspects of the game  and the fact that multiplayer in this game is much more inclusive and effective than ac games in the past  i amean in new leaf  there was only one player who could be mayor  aka only one decision maker  and i wouldid not see nearly the same amount of outrage  the fact of theabsolutely wonderful to play  anyone who is negative review bombing is ignoring all of the wonderful aspects of the game  and the fact that multiplayer in this game is much more inclusive and effective than ac games in the past  i amean in new leaf  there was only one player who could be mayor  aka only one decision maker  and i wouldid not see nearly the same amount of outrage  the fact of the matter is nothe switch is a singer player device that offers multiplayer options  and they are not obligated to do anything  additionally  people are not being patient enough to get through the introductory period in game  after you wait through the introductory period  all characters will eventually be able to add things outside and terraform  i absolutely despise how susceptible people are to outrage culture  and how impatient people are  if you are not patient enough to play this game  then that s on you because the nature of ac is noto make progress slowly  sorry you all were not instantly gratified  expand

613,stays true to the series while adding new things to do such as collecting materials to create tools and items  full and fresh textures with vivid colors  it is really a beautiful game  if you like the other animal crossing games you will find some joy in this game 
614,very chill game broo  perfect to play with friend or fn  beautiful graphics  baitulmaljaya
615,the game itself if you are playing single player is a winner  but proceed with caution if you are playing multiplayer on the same switch due to limited features  but my rating is just for the single player campaign 
616,it is really relaxing and helps my anxiety the only downside is nothat progression is locked behind the first player to boot up the game but as long as that first player is invested in the game then it is really a very minor problem that s easily fixed and not the game breaking thing the other review ers say it it
617,11 10  i have played this since 2008 2009  amazing and unique game  the characters are too cute  the customization is great  and it feels good to just vibe   it is a shame a bunch of babies had to ruin the score to get a point  across  maybe if they pulled some weeds they d feel better 
618,the game is currently broken and does not allow you to make amy progress whatsoever if you are not the first person to open the game so if you try to open the game on your profile after someone already did  the game forces you to play on someone else s island and you cannot do anything at all  just run around catching sih  bugs and shaking trees for eternity

620,1 island per switch and all progression limited to the 1st player   desperate cash grab from nintendo to encourage you to buy a 2nd switch  this is very disappointing given they marketed the game with a strong social element  local coop element is also pointless with player 2 being unable to do most things 
621,the single player looks great  however as the second player to start playing on this console  this game is a waste of time and energy  until the co op is fixed i cannot imagine ever being able to enjoy this game  as i am essentially just an npc 
622,the one island system is ridiculous  and the local play does not looks like a nintendo game  i amean limited vision and no split iscreen and you wouldo not progress to your character 
623,in brief  it is impressive that nintendo managed to create a family game that in no way caters for families the issues with the primary resident versus other players is are well documented  so i will not rehash them here  what s particularly disappointing is nothat anyone could have foreseen this  it is a family game and  given that there is only one island per switch console  more than onein brief  it is impressive that nintendo managed to create a family game that in no way caters for families the issues with the primary resident versus other players is are well documented  so i will not rehash them here  what s particularly disappointing is nothat anyone could have foreseen this  it is a family game and  given that there is only one island per switch console  more than one person is likely to want to play it  unless you ve got a very small family it would not have been difficult to allow players 2  to contribute to things like building new houses  but instead they re just left out in the cold  in this particular case they can read the construction sign  but cannot see the requirements or provide materials without sending them to the primary player it makes a certain sort of sense to only allow one person to make significant modifications to the island  but even then it would not be a particularly big ask to allow the primary player to grant the rights to players 2 similarly  resources like rocks are relatively limited and are handled on a per island basis  that is  if one player harvests the rock  by hitting it with a shovel   you can get up to eight items per rock without destroying it  no other player can harvest that rock the same day  because of this  sharing resources between two people is challenging   three or more must be a nightmare nook points to get tickets to semi random islands to harvest are a partial solution  but the rate at which one can gather nook points slows rapidly as you progress through the game to the point where this looks like it is going to cease to be viable very soon  5 6 days into the game overall i am really  really disappointed and i generally expect a lot more from nintendo when it comes to games that can be played by the whole family  i am not sure what nintendo s goal here is  perhaps that we should have a switch and copy of the game per member of the household  if so  that s a losing bet  for sure  expand
624,if you only want to play alone  and nobody else in your household wants to play  then it is a good game god forbid anybody else want to play though  sucks to be them  they cannot create their own island  and they cannot really contribute in any meaningful way  instead being forced to sit in the background while you wouldo everything worth while and story driven what the heck was nintendoif you only want to play alone  and nobody else in your household wants to play  then it is a good game god forbid anybody else want to play though  sucks to be them  they cannot create their own island  and they cannot really contribute in any meaningful way  instead being forced to sit in the background while you wouldo everything worth while and story driven what the heck was nintendo thinking  this is absurd  expand

633,limiting the number of accounts island on a family game is appalling  if you want multiple people in your house to play you are required to have multiple switch s even though nintendo allow you to have multiple profiles on one switch this game and progress is locked to one profile

639,in relevance to all these 0s you could always only have 1 town  this has been a thing in every multiplayer installment of animal crossing  every single one  the point is noto have multiple people cooperate on one island rather than compete  in any case  that is one facet of this game  that is one little thing  a majority of the gameplay is solo  if you went into this expecting somethingin relevance to all these 0s you could always only have 1 town  this has been a thing in every multiplayer installment of animal crossing  every single one  the point is noto have multiple people cooperate on one island rather than compete  in any case  that is one facet of this game  that is one little thing  a majority of the gameplay is solo  if you went into this expecting something different  that s not at the fault of the game at all the fact that many cite the multiplayer as what makes this game a 0 out of 10 speaks levels to how amazing it is  imagine for example if someone hated how boring a game like mario maker is if you wouldid not have internet  that s what these complaints amount to almost every system has been streamlined and made easier or expanded upon with the exception of one  tools  furniture can be obtained in many ways  now randomly dropping from balloons  rather than just specific items  being able to be crafted  being able to be bought with both bells and nook miles  given away by villagers  found in trees  gifted by special characters  and of course from friends  on top of this  an improved customization system allows for you to change the appearance of many items on the fly  and for those that allow custom designs  that system has been expanded in all senses of the word  pixel art is now smoothed out  making it less immersion breaking  you can store a myriad of designs rather than 16  you have absolute control over the palette you color with instead of presets placing furniture is also a lot easier  taking ideas from pocket camp and happy home designer  furniture can be manipulated on a much smaller set of tiles than in previous games  a 1 tile wide object can be placed on half tiles  for example  an overhead view can be utilized in homemaking to manipulate many objects at a time  wall items can be placed anywhere on the wall  even vertically above each other  light objects are now dynamic  allowing you to really set the mood of your home beyond just their color furniture can of course  now be placed outside  meaning you have control over your entire town instead of simply your house and a small handful of monuments  this opens up the floodgates for a truly custom experience  and in a few weeks time  i am excited to visit the towns of strangers to see the creations they built villagers have a lot more personality now  each one will interact with the world around them and have their own tastes in furniture and clothing  while before  their personality amounted simply to what bit of dialog they spat out when greeting you at best  sporty villager always talks about sports  this has been expanded into them actually having a preference for what furniture they want on the island  what things they want you to craft  what they give you  i had a villager give me a hat once and i wore it  in previous games  that would be the end of that exchange  but in new horizons  later talking to the villager  he had thanked me for actually wearing his gift from days prior  they acknowledge what objects are made for now  you will have them say i exercise with this kettle bell  or this wooden double bed is so comfortable to sleep in  rather than this is my favorite  insert furniture name here  over and over  you will find npcs sleeping under trees  or reading a book with their glasses on  or dusting their home  it feels more alive now  for the flaws  kind of  new horizons puts you in the role of a resident who just moved onto a deserted island  and you have to build up from there  now  this is a very interesting experience starting out  and i actually love the idea of it  you gather materials to build your tools to build better things and unlock more decor or better tools  a la many survival games  the issue with it however is nothe late game  when you get to the end of minecraft  terraria  ark  what have you  you have the best tools that almost never break  there are no equivalents thus far  the best tools are twice as good as the base tools  which isn t fantastic the next issue is 1 island  which while minor  is still an issue as with all the creative opportunity  you have but one canvas to work on  if you want two distinctly themed islands  you have to remove the first to do that  and it is a little heartbreaking other than those two things however  the game improves on everything animal crossing  and i would recommend it to all switch owners  and say it is a necessity for any animal crossing player  expand

641,i created an account to mention how great the game is  and also i paid attention to the fact that as soon as nintendo talked about multiplayer they talked about one island per console  so i wouldid not just run out to buy this not knowing what i was getting  the game is beautiful  and all the additions made to the game are fantastic  the crafting is great  the fact that you can modify thei created an account to mention how great the game is  and also i paid attention to the fact that as soon as nintendo talked about multiplayer they talked about one island per console  so i wouldid not just run out to buy this not knowing what i was getting  the game is beautiful  and all the additions made to the game are fantastic  the crafting is great  the fact that you can modify the island is great  now that you are building everything yourself it feels like there is way more to do than the previous games  10 10  expand
642,it is a great visit back to the series  i guess i am not too blasted away by the one island per switch because my wife and i have had our own for various other reasons and games long before this  and it is not like it was a secret before the game launched 
643,a great addition to the animal crossing game franchise  it is very upsetting to see people give the game a zero because you cannot have your own island when sharing a switch  while i get this frustration i wouldo not think it is a ploy for nintendo to sell more switches  they have sold many already and previous animal crossing games have had this format  i wouldo not like it much either  but i am the onlya great addition to the animal crossing game franchise  it is very upsetting to see people give the game a zero because you cannot have your own island when sharing a switch  while i get this frustration i wouldo not think it is a ploy for nintendo to sell more switches  they have sold many already and previous animal crossing games have had this format  i wouldo not like it much either  but i am the only one that uses my switch so i am not affected  also  seeing people say that this game has no direct story line have you never played an animal crossing game    expand
644,do not listen to the user reviews  the game is downright amazing  was never an animal crossing fan until my wife and i played this notogether  we are hooked 
645,another great animal crossing installment  it keeps all the basics you love from the old games while adding new islands to explore and a fun crafting system 
646,un juego fantástico  con muchas opciones  con el cual puedes relajarte y jugarlos con tu familia
647,any reviews stating that there is only one island per console are true and valid  and i completely understand why anyone with friends would be disappointed by this game  but the people who keep saying  its slow and confusing to progress  or  i should not have to wait days to get something  have no idea what they re talking about  this isn t cod my dudes  you bought a sim game  would youany reviews stating that there is only one island per console are true and valid  and i completely understand why anyone with friends would be disappointed by this game  but the people who keep saying  its slow and confusing to progress  or  i should not have to wait days to get something  have no idea what they re talking about  this isn t cod my dudes  you bought a sim game  would you write the same review for minecraft  you are not supposed to rush the story and finish the game  this isn t a speedrun  it is a form of escapism and just because the end goal isn t to send tom nook hurtling into the depths of hell to save the earth does not give you the right to give it a bad review like it is a poorly made game  if you are gonna do that  there are plenty of valid reasons to complain about this game  other than the weird one island thing  it is very fun and i thoroughly enjoy it  expand
648,100  worth the wait  enough like the old animal crossing games to keep the same feel but enough new additions to make it fresh and new
649,so this game is better than any animal crossing game before it  it adds a ton of new features and adds to the flavor of the world of animal crossing  helping you become more invested in your game over all however there have been a number of complains about the one island per console  this has always been the case for animal crossing  that anyone playing on the same console and orso this game is better than any animal crossing game before it  it adds a ton of new features and adds to the flavor of the world of animal crossing  helping you become more invested in your game over all however there have been a number of complains about the one island per console  this has always been the case for animal crossing  that anyone playing on the same console and or cart would share the world with their other family members  gamecube is nothe exception because it had memory cards  just like before  if everyone wants their own isolated experience  then you need to have your own system  that s what the switch lite is for  it is meant to be the 3ds ds gba to the wii u wii gc of its generation  except we get to play all the same games now  so like before  get your own system and copy of the game  business as usual  you probably were a single console multiple handheld family before  so be a multiple switch family  expand
650,1  this game is absolutely phenomenal  a perfect follow up to new leaf  i cannot stop fishing and catching bugs and exploring the other deserted islands  i cannot wait to be able to use amiibos and move stitches into my island 2  animal crossing has always been one town per memory card console  it is been like this from the first iteration of the dang game on gamecub  you had to buy a1  this game is absolutely phenomenal  a perfect follow up to new leaf  i cannot stop fishing and catching bugs and exploring the other deserted islands  i cannot wait to be able to use amiibos and move stitches into my island 2  animal crossing has always been one town per memory card console  it is been like this from the first iteration of the dang game on gamecub  you had to buy a second memory card to have a second town 3  there was so much media surrounding this game that warned y all you could not have a second island  it was quite literally everywhere   it ishould not have been a surprise to you  and if it was  maybe you should research games before you buy them  expand
651,the game is deep  charming and endless  customization and quality of life improvements make new horizons the best ac to date  and please stop giving the game zeroes for not having features that were not advertised  nintendo made it clear that it was one island per switch  i wouldo not agree with it  but at least give the game a seven or eight and give a substantive review 
652,best animal crossing ever   do not listen to bad reviews  they are just mad cause they spent all there money on toilet paper 1 island thing stinks but does not make this a bad game great job nintendo 
653,very good game  i have never played an animal crossing game before  but this notitle
654,this game is absolutely a joy  sure  the first few days are boring  because you are trying to figure it out  but the more you figure it out  you more fun you have meeting new friends  customizing your town  and building new things 
655,this game is amazing  period  i have seen many people say that the lack of the ability to have multiple islands has completely ruined their experience  but to me  that does not even compare to all the things done right in this game  refinement of new features  amazing new features  it is all there  even if this game isn t the best switch game quality wise  it certainly feels like the mostthis game is amazing  period  i have seen many people say that the lack of the ability to have multiple islands has completely ruined their experience  but to me  that does not even compare to all the things done right in this game  refinement of new features  amazing new features  it is all there  even if this game isn t the best switch game quality wise  it certainly feels like the most polished of the bunch  definitely worth the buy  expand
656,it is a fun game  arguably 10 10 if you are going to be the only one playing it in your household  if you plan on having more than one person play on the same console  do not even bother buying it  it is a shame they let greed get the better of them by trying to force you to purchase multiple consoles considering how great this game would be without this problem  unfortunately  it is a hugeit is a fun game  arguably 10 10 if you are going to be the only one playing it in your household  if you plan on having more than one person play on the same console  do not even bother buying it  it is a shame they let greed get the better of them by trying to force you to purchase multiple consoles considering how great this game would be without this problem  unfortunately  it is a huge problem for many  expand

660,the limitation of one island per switch  not per cartridge  per switch  is nonsensical  it is obvious nintendo is just trying to sell more switch consoles  this means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent  player 2 can barely do anything  and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further  player 2 cannot make any administrative decisions the limitation of one island per switch  not per cartridge  per switch  is nonsensical  it is obvious nintendo is just trying to sell more switch consoles  this means only one person in your family can enjoy the game to its fullest extent  player 2 can barely do anything  and their progression is blocked until player 1 progresses further  player 2 cannot make any administrative decisions  players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources  i had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game  expand
661,terrible experience if you have more than one player on your console the game is unplayable 
662,one island per console is ridiculous  selling my cartridge  nintendo  you guys are so backwards 
663,so looking forward to play this game with my wife but with the limited local multiplayer setup  it makes the game frustrating to play as only the main player gets to progress the story while the other player get to do nothing but sit there and wait  nintendo even lock it iso that only 1 switch can have only 1 island  wow you guys are more greddy then ea  sorry nintendo i will stop playingso looking forward to play this game with my wife but with the limited local multiplayer setup  it makes the game frustrating to play as only the main player gets to progress the story while the other player get to do nothing but sit there and wait  nintendo even lock it iso that only 1 switch can have only 1 island  wow you guys are more greddy then ea  sorry nintendo i will stop playing your games now  im truly and deeply saddened by you people  expand
664,if you wouldid your did research you would know you can only have 1 island per console  same as every other game  do not review bomb because you cannot read 
665,could not have come out in a more perfect time  really enjoy playing it with the family 
666,best switch game must do gamegood good goodnintendo bestbriliants i wouldo everyday from releasing date
667,absolutely amazing  all the customizing is so fun and the graphics are so cute 
668,the game sucked  no interesting gameplay nor style  the game does not offer much at like with new leaf  you are better off just playing the original 
669,i ll admit  i am not the best person to ask for a review of this game  but that s only because i have not gotten to play this game because of nintendo forcing players to only have one island per console for some quick context  my twin brother bought this game for our birthday and began playing immediately at launch  i watched him play here and there and became interested seeing asi ll admit  i am not the best person to ask for a review of this game  but that s only because i have not gotten to play this game because of nintendo forcing players to only have one island per console for some quick context  my twin brother bought this game for our birthday and began playing immediately at launch  i watched him play here and there and became interested seeing as neither he or i had ever played an animal crossing game before but we both had only heard good things about the series  i wouldecided to let my brother play for a few days on his own before starting up my own save  when i wouldid  i gathered my parents and had them watch me as i figured they too would probably enjoy the game and i wanted to introduce it to them with me so we could have a new bonding experience  to my dismay however  i was able to create my own villager  but not my own island my brother has done nothing but tell me how much fun the game is  with my friends and the internet echoing his praises  and yet unless i wouldecide to fork over an extra  360 to purchase a new switch and copy of the game  i will be locked out of this game s full experience while this may seem like a bold claim to some  when you have a game centered around a small island  and then make players share that one island per console  you are essentially making them share a save file  maybe i would not be so upset about this fact if it was not common for every other game on the switch to allow multiple save files per console account i have heard the argument that this has always been a feature in the animal crossing series  to which i say  look at pokemon  when pokemon transitioned to the switch  they dropped having only one save per device  and people are now able to experience the newest pokemon games with multiple saves  i wouldo not see any logical reason why animal crossing is unable to make the same transition i would also like to bring up the argument of target demographics  while it is notrue that the animal crossing series has always been able to connect with a wide audience and demographic  which is what makes the series so great i am told  i still imagine that the target audience of this game series is children  seeing as the game contains a cute cartoony art style and is rated e for everyone by the esrb  allowing children to also experience the game  i cannot imagine the arguments going on in households that contain multiple children right now over who gets to play on the island and who gets to do what on the island the bottom line here is nothat nintendo is shooting themselves in the foot by not including multiple islands as this both angers old fans and limits the amount of new players able to experience the game  the hardware is clearly there  seeing as every other game on the switch allows multiple saves across switch accounts  including old games that did not before moving to the switch like pokemon at the beginning of this review i said i am not the best reviewer of this game seeing as i have been unable to play it  but for that reason alone  i am rating this game 1 out of 10  i can see no logic in this choice of only allowing one island per console  i was really excited to try this series out for the first time  only to have that excitement squashed due to nintendo limiting it is player base for this new game  i wouldo not doubt the game is good  i just wish i could play it along with everyone else  expand
670,this game shows the worst face of nintendo as a game company  now it is no longer enough to have several copies of the same game if several people want to enjoy it at home  something that already went against how the industry has evolved for many years  but on top of that you have to have several consoles as well  terribly abusive 
671,if anyone has multi people who want to play this game do not buy  you can only have one island per switch  first player has full access to the game anyone else is limited 
672,if you share your switch and was excited to both play this game  think again  understandable that you share worlds but as a second player u cannot access the entire game  certain vital tools  think shovel and axe  and upgrades are unavailable  u cannot contribute to quests or even upgrade from a tent to a house   what the   nintendo  give us the option of 2 islands or at leastif you share your switch and was excited to both play this game  think again  understandable that you share worlds but as a second player u cannot access the entire game  certain vital tools  think shovel and axe  and upgrades are unavailable  u cannot contribute to quests or even upgrade from a tent to a house   what the   nintendo  give us the option of 2 islands or at least send diy packs to the 2nd player so they can play a as well and upgrade their house   this is crap  will have to buy a second switch so we can both play get  ed  expand

688,super cute  but as a second player i cannot do anything and there is no point to even playing the game  it is ludicrous that in order to create my own island and actually play the game i have to get a second switch  really   solid money grab  nintendo  boo

690,in addition to the absolutely ridiculous stunt nintendo pulled by forcing you to have to buy an entire new console if more than one person wants to play the game  the game is boring and not rewarding at all  it feels like a mobile game because you can barely do anything before running out of things to do  at least in mobile games they give you the option to pay money to progress  harvestin addition to the absolutely ridiculous stunt nintendo pulled by forcing you to have to buy an entire new console if more than one person wants to play the game  the game is boring and not rewarding at all  it feels like a mobile game because you can barely do anything before running out of things to do  at least in mobile games they give you the option to pay money to progress  harvest moon  awl is way better than this game and it came out over a decade ago  animal crossing has to be one of the most overrated games of all time  expand
691,this game is amazing  people who rate it low are idiots  they should know what it is about and how it works  nintendo were telling you how the one island per console works months ago  this game is great and the best animal crossing yet

693,i am going to be generous and give this game a 1  i have waited nearly ten years for a brand new animal crossing game and after all these years of developing and planning i find out that they decided not to give isabelle a double barrel shot gun and include zero demons  worst  crossover  ever  nintendoomed 
694,fantastic in every way  never played the any of the previous games and if they re a fraction as good as this  then i amissed out 
695,while the one island per switch conundrum can be problematic to the game s family audience  the game itself is phenomenal and visually beautiful  the amount of love and effort put into this game causes the environment  soundtrack  and character to pop out of the screen  the ambience is breathtaking  and the writing is some of the best in the series thus far  while nintendo has had manywhile the one island per switch conundrum can be problematic to the game s family audience  the game itself is phenomenal and visually beautiful  the amount of love and effort put into this game causes the environment  soundtrack  and character to pop out of the screen  the ambience is breathtaking  and the writing is some of the best in the series thus far  while nintendo has had many problems in the past  the amount of love put into new horizons pays off in various ways  the previously mentioned one island per switch conundrum is just that  a problem  the restriction is not  however  a game ruining characteristic  expand

698,an amazing game as always nintendo  do not let the review bombers get to you  this is a must have for the nintendo switch
699,have played every animal crossing game that s come out  and this one is absolutely the best  looks great  lots of fun already  and with updates coming to add even more 
700,this game is so calming and fun  people have been tanking the score because you can only have one island but tanking a score because of one little thing is petty  i greatly enjoyed the game and have no trouble sharing  since that s how the game is meant to be played 
701,muy entretenido  es verdad que tiene carencias  pero no son nada comparado a todo lo positivo   juego con mi esposa y nos divertimos por horas diariamente  y eso que es iniciando no me imagino en un par de semanas que tengamos todo desbloqueado
702,an amazing game from the graphics to the gameplay  found myself addicted within a day 
703,muy divertido   me encanta y si ameten alguna actualización será un autentico juegazo 
704,animal crossing new horizons  is by far the best game in the series  the game starts off differently from every other animal crossing you start in a barren island with 2 other villagers and a very bare bones shop  you also cannot reach the majority of the island yet  as you progress you gain new tools that help collect bugs  fish  and building supplies  you will eventually see more shops moveanimal crossing new horizons  is by far the best game in the series  the game starts off differently from every other animal crossing you start in a barren island with 2 other villagers and a very bare bones shop  you also cannot reach the majority of the island yet  as you progress you gain new tools that help collect bugs  fish  and building supplies  you will eventually see more shops move in as you also gain new tools like the pole vault and ladder to explore the rest of the island  it is extremely fun to see the island develop into a full on town  while the game does take days to get new things  you can easily skip that process by using time travel  i personally do not  my main complaint is nothe multiplayer  for at least where i am now  there is not much to do besides visit your friends island and not much more  but in end i wouldo really enjoy my time playing the game and think it is an easy 10 10 game  expand
705,animal crossing  new horizons is definitely the best in the series   it takes everything up a notch   the characters are as lovable as in population growing again  and the world is as huge as well   building the world how you want from new leaf is completely ramped up  and the world is more full of fish and bugs than ever   crafting completely changes the game  allowing the player to enjoyanimal crossing  new horizons is definitely the best in the series   it takes everything up a notch   the characters are as lovable as in population growing again  and the world is as huge as well   building the world how you want from new leaf is completely ramped up  and the world is more full of fish and bugs than ever   crafting completely changes the game  allowing the player to enjoy the game at night or early morning  even though shops are closed   this is notruly a triumphant return for animal crossing  and the game will be even better when the dlc arrives   if you enjoyed any animal crossing game  you will love this one  and if you ve never given animal crossing a shot  now s certainly the time   those new to animal crossing will love the game  and those who have played an ac game  or fans since the original  like me  will absolutely adore it     kkslider  expand
706,this game is a heap if fun for all animal crossing veterans and new players  the new crafting feature is really intuitive and it dowant feel like some crafting is put of reach like in other games  the game is rewarding and always gives you something to work on  i am really glad i picked it up 
707,while i think the in home multi player stuff is aittle borked  the game is gorgeous and so very very enjoyable otherwise 
708,es un juego fantástico donde puedes hacer un montón de cosas súper interesantes
709,polished and fun  some features that other animal crossings start with are now behind a few long steps  town hall  but the new landscaping and online are amazing fun 
710,we love it  i would rate it 11   super customizable  fun and challenging  gender expansive  visit friends and share messages and items  and it is only getting better as we play 
711,really love this game so far  think it is a very modern take on a game that could of aged badly  really easy to pick up and play and i look forward to what or who will show up the next day  looking forward to the future content and a living cycle of dlc

713,awesome graphics and gameplay  the villagers are really cute  a gem  i really enjoy the series 
714,amazing game  best in the series so far  multiplayer is best enjoyed when everyone has their own switch and own copy of the game  i look forward to playing this one for years to come like i wouldid with the first one on gamecube 
715,i could not wait to play this game  i have been playing animal crossing since it first came out for the gamecube  that being said i am really impressed with what this new game brings to the table  i absolutely love the single player gameplay with new horizon  it is just as relaxing as all of the previous games and it adds so much more to do  i also enjoyed inviting a close friend of mine toi could not wait to play this game  i have been playing animal crossing since it first came out for the gamecube  that being said i am really impressed with what this new game brings to the table  i absolutely love the single player gameplay with new horizon  it is just as relaxing as all of the previous games and it adds so much more to do  i also enjoyed inviting a close friend of mine to visit my island  it was very easy to do and we both enjoyed our time   i would say the crappy part about it was having to type to each other to communicate  that was a pain to do but nevertheless we still enjoyed visiting each other  i have yet to try to play with family  we do have two switch systems  however  my son is notoo young to know how to play and my husband cares more for smash bros than anything else lol  however  despite it not personally affecting me there ishould have still been a much better way this could have been implemented for those it does have an effect on  it is not fair that they have to go through so much  even as far as buying another system  just to play with one another when they should not have to  if i remember correctly  in the first animal crossing game you could all live in the same location  so why make it different now  i will however still be fair with my rating  i wouldo not think the game deserves a 0 because of that as it brings a lot to the table  but i cannot give it a 10 when multiplayer is not up to par  expand
716,i love this game and i am very excited to have it  it makes you play it like you should  keeps you having to come back with a little bit every day  i personally do not mind only having one island  that is how the game was when the original came out  i love that i can organise my island and the crafting is interesting  its the same as the old but made in a new refreshing way 
717,animal crossing new horizons is a refreshing entry in the series by combining the best aspects of previous games and polishing them  as a whole new horizons most resembles the gamecube entry from the early 2000s  with this resemblence comes a few features being cut but in exchange many have been added mostly in the way of customization from the freedom to place whatever you want on theanimal crossing new horizons is a refreshing entry in the series by combining the best aspects of previous games and polishing them  as a whole new horizons most resembles the gamecube entry from the early 2000s  with this resemblence comes a few features being cut but in exchange many have been added mostly in the way of customization from the freedom to place whatever you want on the island to the ability to change your characters physical appearance when a mirror is present  overall nh is a fantastic entry  expand
718,i have been a fan of the animal crossing series for a long time and the newest entry is a worthy add on the the on going franchise  the new mechanics that were added were some that fans like myself have been asking for for a long time  and now that they have been added i could only dream of the things that could come in the future  the only complaint i have is nothe slow start  but that si have been a fan of the animal crossing series for a long time and the newest entry is a worthy add on the the on going franchise  the new mechanics that were added were some that fans like myself have been asking for for a long time  and now that they have been added i could only dream of the things that could come in the future  the only complaint i have is nothe slow start  but that s fine  i wouldo not mind taking my time with a game  expand
719,the one island thing is indefensible  even if they told us up front  how many families have more than one child that would want to run their own island without their siblings interfering but that isn t why i gave this a zero  the big reason to me is nothe absolutely clunky and slow menu controls  and constant poor decisions that smack you in the face every time you are trying to enjoy thethe one island thing is indefensible  even if they told us up front  how many families have more than one child that would want to run their own island without their siblings interfering but that isn t why i gave this a zero  the big reason to me is nothe absolutely clunky and slow menu controls  and constant poor decisions that smack you in the face every time you are trying to enjoy the game i get that it is supposed to be slow and charming  but i think ac fans are too quick to defend the game s charm that they think any criticism on the game is unfounded  if ac fans actually told the devs things that were not great  the series might have progressed since it was created this series was created on the gc when a lot of devs were still figuring out the do s and dont s of game development  things like if you are going to make a game about crafting and customization  do not make the menu interface insanely slow  do not preface that menu with slow  crawling text that asks if you want to craft  do not only let us craft one item at a time  then do not make a five second craft and tadaa  animation that can be sped up by like  5  by jamming on the buttons  and then do not make us have to answer a slow  crawling question about going back into the menu  and doing it all over again  if i want to make a couple darkwood chairs  i have to slowly make each of them one at a  slow  time  then exit that menu and slowly enter the customization menu  and proceed to slowly customize them all  also one at a time if i want to figure out how much items sell for  i have to slowly sell each different item alone  because there is no other way to know  also  you have to deal with slow crawling intro text  and you get booted out of the whole thing to start over each time  you know what they could have done  1  made it quicker  2  made the shops show the sell price as you hover over them  3  add the pricing somewhere in all that empty space on the critterpedia entries  so many options to have not done it it annoyingly  but they figured out how to avoid all of them do not tell me this is nothe charm of the game  the speed was charming back when there was barely anything to do in the game  for some asinine reason  they thought that clunky charm is equal no matter how it is utilized  but in a game that is now all about crafting and customizing at a scale it is never done before  someone on their team should have said uhh  this actually really sucks when all you are trying to do is build and customize a couple chairs and a table  maybe we should change the crafting menu  at least  i am hoping that at some point  the shop evolves and they re like haha  look at all these new features  are not you happy that it isn t so annoying anymore  but even if they did that  i would still be upset that they chose to screw with us instead of just making it good it isucks  because the large majority of the game is good   but it is like someone gave you a delicious ice cream  but then slapped you in the back of your head every time you try to enjoy it  expand
720,i am thoroughly disappointed at many different things about this game  everything from only having one island per switch to the overarching theme of nintendo lately  which is noto over monetize every single ip that they have 
721,i would love this game if it were not for the multiplayer  forcing two players to be on split iscreen is bad enough  but add in the fact that each switch system can only have one island and you get a giant steaming pile of sh t  this game could have been amazing but those things completely ruin everything it could have been  i will not be buying another ac title  if there ever is one  hope theyi would love this game if it were not for the multiplayer  forcing two players to be on split iscreen is bad enough  but add in the fact that each switch system can only have one island and you get a giant steaming pile of sh t  this game could have been amazing but those things completely ruin everything it could have been  i will not be buying another ac title  if there ever is one  hope they let the series die here instead of running it into the ground further  expand

726,if you ve played animal crossing before then you know what to expect   that s my only complaint   if you ve never played the series though  you need this game in your life   i wouldo love crossing animals though  so i ll continue to throw bells at nintendo as long as they make this series  who am i kidding   i ll throw money at nintendo as long as they re nintendo 
727,just so polished  the soundscapes are as breathtaking as the visuals  the fish  the sky  and the local flora have all gotten massive updates to make the jump to hd impressive  the only qualm i have is with the multiplayer connection  and hopefully that will be patched in a future update
728,i think this might just be one of the best animal crossings yet  i know there is a lot of flack for the one island thing but i wouldo not think that learning how to share and not be a jerk is a bad thing  ultimately there is a lot to do and collect and the multiplayer functions are neat  i just wish you could go to random islands with friends  it would make the grinding a lot more fun  also thei think this might just be one of the best animal crossings yet  i know there is a lot of flack for the one island thing but i wouldo not think that learning how to share and not be a jerk is a bad thing  ultimately there is a lot to do and collect and the multiplayer functions are neat  i just wish you could go to random islands with friends  it would make the grinding a lot more fun  also the length of the in game chat message sometimes seems too short  expand

733,they only allow one island per console  allowing one only was a big mistake  would not recommend if you share a console 
734,i wouldo not like leaving bad reviews like this  but it is the only option for me as a consumer  the 1 island restriction is notrash and far worse than previous games  the second player has an overall worse experience with many features locked out from them  and unlike previous games this is not solved by simply buying a new memory card or a second game cart  this is not consumer friendly andi wouldo not like leaving bad reviews like this  but it is the only option for me as a consumer  the 1 island restriction is notrash and far worse than previous games  the second player has an overall worse experience with many features locked out from them  and unlike previous games this is not solved by simply buying a new memory card or a second game cart  this is not consumer friendly and forces players in the same household to buy multiple switches if they want the full experience  at least in new leaf you cannotransfer your house as the second player if you wanted to be the mayor of your own town  such a feature is not possible here  to add insult to injury the lack of real cloud saves is a joke  especially when it is a service we pay extra for  a first party service like cloud saves should be compatible with all first party games  expand

740,i had such high hopes for this game  and i was immensely let down  only being able to have one island is ridiculous  we have to have two separate nso accounts  but cannot have two saves  nintendo  you are showing your ea colors 
741,annoying  repetitive  a tedious hassle  way too simple on tutorials while also not giving gameplay tips important guidal info  could have been really good if made by someone else  could have had a good co op for those that are not rich  dragged out  not recommended for kids  or adults unless you enjoy a simple yet complicated game 
742,bought a switch and this game for 2 kids who will be spending a lot of time at home for the foreseeable future   can only have 1 island   very disappointed 
743,incredible game and a must buy  those giving it low scores are being petty and nitpicky over the smallest things  by far the most wonderful game ever to come out of the animal crossing franchise 
744,this game is fantastic and beautiful  the only thing i would change is incorporating the ability for multiple users on the console to find materials needed for larger projects and drop them off at the project which was a feature in new leaf  you can access everything the main account can by looking in the second page of tommy and timmy s store  this game is great these games havethis game is fantastic and beautiful  the only thing i would change is incorporating the ability for multiple users on the console to find materials needed for larger projects and drop them off at the project which was a feature in new leaf  you can access everything the main account can by looking in the second page of tommy and timmy s store  this game is great these games have always only had one island per console  expand
745,my literal only complaint is nothat i cannot craft in batches  this is a beautiful and amazing game for those of us who have played since the original  i understand frustrations for those who are playing this as their first animal crossing  i feel like most of the low reviews come from a lack of understanding of where the game comes from 
746,one island per system  really  this is like owning a car and only one person can set the seats or radio also the cloud backup system is  well  it isn t there  so when you wouldo play with a household on switch and something happens to it  everyone loses everything 
747,animal crossing made the impossible  surpass animal crossing new leaf  this is nothe definitive game in the series  amazing note  do not pay attention to the average mark  cause they are giving low averages with no sense 
748,i am a first timer with animal crossing and i am pleasantly surprised  the world is so charming and the game is designed to be explored at your own pace  do not let the cuteness fool you  underneath the whimsical appearance lies a brilliantly designed game  that s a whole lotta fun i cannotell that time and care went into this notitle  it is in the details  just because things are noti am a first timer with animal crossing and i am pleasantly surprised  the world is so charming and the game is designed to be explored at your own pace  do not let the cuteness fool you  underneath the whimsical appearance lies a brilliantly designed game  that s a whole lotta fun i cannotell that time and care went into this notitle  it is in the details  just because things are not exploding on screen  does not mean there is less going on  the fun i am having has to do with the freedom to really design my own little oasis  i usually shy away from design driven games like minecraft because i get bored very quickly  this however feels very different  there are goals to achieve and rewards to receive  the game gradually teaches you it is mechanics in a way that does not make me fatigued or bored  there is always something just around the corner to perk your interest i cannot believe the negative reviews this game has received  i am hoping these are kids that are review bombing  the reviews are so juvenile in composition and riddled with silly  subjective reasoning  it cannot be written by anyone older than 12  no offense  expand
749,first and best animal crossing by far  do not listen to the mad multiplayer people this game is amazing 
750,it is a good game honestly  lots of things to do and i really enjoy it  it is probably one of the more chill games i can play 
751,this is an incredible game and the problems people are review bombing this with will not be problems after a week of play 
752,ok we are addicted to this game  the low average is from users putting in zeroes for it not allowing more than one island per switch  which granted  sucks  but none the less this game is nearly perfect 
753,an excellent addition to the series  new horizons expands on the tried and true formula of laid back task management and town expansion by adding a simple yet deep crafting component  and then allowing players to apply this noto the island as a whole for those new to the game  yes it revolves around you paying off your debt to a capitalist raccoon  but the tasks you undertake to reach thatan excellent addition to the series  new horizons expands on the tried and true formula of laid back task management and town expansion by adding a simple yet deep crafting component  and then allowing players to apply this noto the island as a whole for those new to the game  yes it revolves around you paying off your debt to a capitalist raccoon  but the tasks you undertake to reach that frankly easy goal are fishing  catching bugs and more  things that play well into the concept of something relaxing while the restriction of one island to console is interesting  i believe it was a choice made to tie it into the other games which have had the same gesture to allow for people to work together on the same island and grow it as a group  while also limiting play time so that one can experience other things  while that may not be everyone s cup of tea  the game was designed by someone who enjoyed these game activities in real life  so perhaps one should take a page out of the creator s book and try them in real life  expand
754,step in and stop review bombing  metacritic  it is unfair for developers and gamers 
755,some of you have never played an animal crossing game and it ishows  this game is great  it improves upon almost every aspect of the game  so sad that some of you feel the need to throw an online tantrum because you wouldid not research the game before buying  to everyone else  buy this game  you will have loads of fun 
756,this game is most likely the best game i have ever played  the amount of things to do is so amazing  however  i can see it not appealing to certain people  this game is a game with basically no action  so if you wouldo not like relaxing games without the rush a fighting shooter game would give you  do not play this  anyways  10 10
757,the game is good  those butthurt people need to calm down with their reviews  i amean nintendo already announced the save thing before they released the game  no one forced you to buy it 
758,what s not to love  would three islands appease you  me  i am okay with my one   lah 
759,i am absolutely in love with animal crossing  new horizons  this game could not have come at a better time  what a fun  chill  play at your own pace game  the graphics are wonderful  the jokes are funny  i cannot say enough good things about it  thank you nintendo for giving us this when we needed it most 
760,created an account just to review this game  it is great if your 1 player per console but otherwise it is just a demo of the game for everyone but the first person to start  critical milestones are locked behind progress that only the person who opened the game first can make  the island representative a petty marketing gimmick to sell more consoles  between this and the scummy mobilecreated an account just to review this game  it is great if your 1 player per console but otherwise it is just a demo of the game for everyone but the first person to start  critical milestones are locked behind progress that only the person who opened the game first can make  the island representative a petty marketing gimmick to sell more consoles  between this and the scummy mobile game  nintendo is on track to become the next ea  expand
761,as has been mentioned many times here already  i wouldo not agree that nintendo should mandate the one user per system restriction they have made by allowing the creation of only one island  this game does not deserve positive reviews until this is remedied 
762,need another switch to play with my girlfriend  didnt think multiplayer through at all nintendo just want you to buy more switch consoles
763,tossing my review in with the rest  i wouldo not mind the sharing the island aspect  a crap idea to be sure  but if that s how the creative minds want to play it then fine i ll play what i find despicable is nothe 2nd  3rd  etc players not being to experience a real game  you are in fact a villager that the main player allows the ability to do what they want  i wouldo not know who in nintendotossing my review in with the rest  i wouldo not mind the sharing the island aspect  a crap idea to be sure  but if that s how the creative minds want to play it then fine i ll play what i find despicable is nothe 2nd  3rd  etc players not being to experience a real game  you are in fact a villager that the main player allows the ability to do what they want  i wouldo not know who in nintendo decided that was a good idea  but imagine living in a household where only one person matters and everyone else is subservient to that one person  kind of goes against the idea of building social ties  sharing and having fun  sharing in my mind isn t only sharing space  but also in sharing responsibility and choice the dictatorial feel of the single console multiplayer of this game destroys its value for me as i am now subservient to player one  i cannot do anything other than farm and wait for player one to plan the city out and progress the story  imagine save locking a pc so only one player can get to play a game  how ridiculous is nothat  well welcome to animal crossing new horizons  want to play the real game like player one  go buy a new switch  expand
764,would be good  but only allows one island per console  even if i could tolerate that  having multiple people on the island is also broken  no other accounts on the console can progress until the first account to play the game does  fix this nintendo 
765,cannot have my own island  cannot even progress the game or help villagers setup their house because i am player 2  literally walking around waiting for player 1 to do something  glad i paid  80aud for one and a half slices of pizza  when they advertised the whole pie  nintendo hates it is fans  but they do not let their hate for you known until you ve already bought their game  disgusting 
766,i love the game  but my only issue with it is nothe necessity to have nintendo switch online to play with friends at all  except for locally which is difficult in this notime 
767,nintendo thinks people like to share an village and t pose in an empty space with nothing to do other than chat  since one player get to do all the chores
768,my girlfriend and i were looking forward to playing together using the couch multiplayer mode  it is not much fun as only one player can make progress and the other just has to walk around and pick things up  slowly  i wouldo not even mind that there is only one island like other people are saying  i think it ishould be a choice  but both players should progress together  or be able to progressmy girlfriend and i were looking forward to playing together using the couch multiplayer mode  it is not much fun as only one player can make progress and the other just has to walk around and pick things up  slowly  i wouldo not even mind that there is only one island like other people are saying  i think it ishould be a choice  but both players should progress together  or be able to progress at their own pace with the same features and golas  perhaps as co  expand
769,the limitation of one island per switch  only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from tom nook and other characters 
770,the game is essentially for a single user per switch   all others do not get anywhere close to the full experience 
771,greedy tactic from nintendo of 1 island per switch  completely ruined the game for me  every other game ever made knows not to do this  shocking 
772,never played ac before this one and i was worried about whether i would like it  but i absolutely adore it  so much fun and just a lovely experience  could not recommend it more 
773,animal crossing new horizons is an excellent game is a game that i cannot stop playing it  the day it launched to today  i wouldid not play any other game  and the online is good there isn t lag  and it is fun  and you gonna have some good laughs
774,great game  the gf and i are sharing the workload and designing the island together  couldnt be happier and it just looks so good on the switch 
775,another great installment in the animal crossing series   keeps the old staples of the series while adding a new but of flavor   plenty of customization both inside and outside of your home 
776,fun  adorable  relaxing  beautiful design  and in the knick of time  could not ask for more 
777,it is my first animal crossing and i am enjowing it a lot  i am doing every single thing i can do and that s a lot of thinks also the collect of all bugs  fishes and fossils is one of my favourite entertiments i can understand why people are annoyed by the fact that is only one island per switch  but is a nice coop too  for people who share island  to build it together  i am doing it withit is my first animal crossing and i am enjowing it a lot  i am doing every single thing i can do and that s a lot of thinks also the collect of all bugs  fishes and fossils is one of my favourite entertiments i can understand why people are annoyed by the fact that is only one island per switch  but is a nice coop too  for people who share island  to build it together  i am doing it with my little brother and we talk about what happens to one or another in the island  althrough only i am the founder of the island  he can do the same things than me  so is nothe same gameplay for us both the art  as music  graphics and gameplay looks good  it just feels the way it must  i think  but there are things that could be better  for example at buying many things  i would like to buy 31 thibgs for examole  instead of doing it in packs of 5  or individually in general i am enjoying this game a lot  but it is not perfect  so almost 10 for me  expand
778,it is more entertaining and intuitive than new leaf  the menus are easier to navigate  there is more stuff to do  it is also very pretty despite the simple character models  but i would prefer this style as opposed to a realistic art style  ps fanboys  new horizons is a treat 
779,honest answer  my wife plays the game almost exclusively but i have enjoyed as well  personally i wouldisagree with the single island issue but comparing it to ea s egregious lootboxes and scummy tactics i think is serious hyperbole  its a genuinely fun sandbox game with a few flaws  it is not meant to have a deep complex narrative other than the one you make for yourselves  please stophonest answer  my wife plays the game almost exclusively but i have enjoyed as well  personally i wouldisagree with the single island issue but comparing it to ea s egregious lootboxes and scummy tactics i think is serious hyperbole  its a genuinely fun sandbox game with a few flaws  it is not meant to have a deep complex narrative other than the one you make for yourselves  please stop overreacting this is almost as bad and cringe as the astral chain and fire emblem review bombings  lets discuss the issues like mature adults and try to get nintendo to respond in kind  not scorched earth tactics we are better than this  expand
780,the text can be lengthy and slow at times but it makes sense  only one island per console is also a bummer but not worth dropping it that far down  it is an overall fun experience with cute characters  fun multiplayer  and cool options of what you can do in the game 
781,multiplayer is broken  there is several issues with the multiplayer for non representative resident players  they are severely limited in progressing the game  the non rr player is unable to unlock the diy recipes acquired through progressing game  lacks access to purchasing items from the catalog that the representative player has bought unlocked cannot use or unlock emotes  cannotmultiplayer is broken  there is several issues with the multiplayer for non representative resident players  they are severely limited in progressing the game  the non rr player is unable to unlock the diy recipes acquired through progressing game  lacks access to purchasing items from the catalog that the representative player has bought unlocked cannot use or unlock emotes  cannot increase relationship with villagers the non rr is unable to progress in the game beyond what the representative player has made that day  and often  not even that and is unable to progress at all the second player serves almost no purpose  if you share an island and are the non rr character  the game is rendered essentially pointless  it desperately needs to be patched  expand
782,an absolutely wonderful game  i have played every animal crossing to date and this is nothe most polished so far  great mechanics  however  the game completely halts progress for second and subsequent players  despite having a great time with what i have already played  i am not going to go back to it because i cannot really do much except customize my house and pay my debt  which is beginningan absolutely wonderful game  i have played every animal crossing to date and this is nothe most polished so far  great mechanics  however  the game completely halts progress for second and subsequent players  despite having a great time with what i have already played  i am not going to go back to it because i cannot really do much except customize my house and pay my debt  which is beginning to get repetitive  i will update this with a better rating if nintendo either allows the second player to progress the same as the first player or lets us create multiple islands  which would be preferable  until then  especially if you want to play this with your family  do not bother  expand
783,ignore the negative ratings  solid game and a lot of fun

785,best game in the series  people complain about the multiplayer  they clearly never played ac before

787,did not plan on making a review but am doing my part to protect this masterpiece from review bombing  this game is wonderful  have played for around 25 hours over the last few days and collecting resources to upgrade the island and design your house is great  if you wanted multiplayer then i am sorry but animal crossing has always been mostly single player  not sure what you were expecting did not plan on making a review but am doing my part to protect this masterpiece from review bombing  this game is wonderful  have played for around 25 hours over the last few days and collecting resources to upgrade the island and design your house is great  if you wanted multiplayer then i am sorry but animal crossing has always been mostly single player  not sure what you were expecting  buy it  i beg you  expand
788,i think people are misunderstanding  most players are not angry over the single island per system  but the fact that players 2 8 have literally 0 impact on the island on new leaf  pretty much all the mayor can do is add buildings or ordinances  that s it  this game excludes a large chunk out of it for the other players  i e  terraformation if you are playing single player  then goodi think people are misunderstanding  most players are not angry over the single island per system  but the fact that players 2 8 have literally 0 impact on the island on new leaf  pretty much all the mayor can do is add buildings or ordinances  that s it  this game excludes a large chunk out of it for the other players  i e  terraformation if you are playing single player  then good for you  but stop taking other people words and distorting them  expand
789,i have 4 young kids and they are very good about sharing the switch we have  and they were excited about animal crossing coming out  i like the switch s ability to have separate saves per account so that each kid can go through the games on their own we pre ordered animal crossing and were excited about its release  well  come to find out  you can only have a single island  peri have 4 young kids and they are very good about sharing the switch we have  and they were excited about animal crossing coming out  i like the switch s ability to have separate saves per account so that each kid can go through the games on their own we pre ordered animal crossing and were excited about its release  well  come to find out  you can only have a single island  per switch  the island is shared by all the accounts  and further more  only the creator of the island can advance the plot or do any major stuff the kids are majorly disappointed  and it is not like i can buy 4 more switches for all 5 of us just for one game  this just ruins the entire game from the start  and there is no good reason not to have an island per account instead of per switch  even if we hypothetically bought 5 copies of the game  it would still only let you play one single island  the only solution would be for me to buy 4 more switches  which is insane  please fix this nintendo  expand
790,sharing the game i am basically  shadowing  player 1  i am only a guest in someone s island and this is ridiculous because i also paid for this game i cannot trigger any events no matter how many hours i play it  i will never go beyond what is achieved by the player 1  and i have to pay for everything that player 1 gets for free no one told us about this before buying this game   wesharing the game i am basically  shadowing  player 1  i am only a guest in someone s island and this is ridiculous because i also paid for this game i cannot trigger any events no matter how many hours i play it  i will never go beyond what is achieved by the player 1  and i have to pay for everything that player 1 gets for free no one told us about this before buying this game   we only knew that we have to share an island  which i thought is weird but manageable if you are smart about using the resources  and according to nintendo it is supposed to be up to 8 persons multiplayer game  well it is not  and i want a refund  expand
791,the trolls who would try and bomb this game s rating can go back to fortnite and continue to offer nothing of value to the world  the game holds true to the series  requires a little extra effort to get the game up to speed than previous titles but it goes well with the current quarantine 
792,i have been playing animal crossing since the gamecube and this is nothe best one  no question 
793,if you are not the primary profile the game is stripped down  lite  version of itself 
794,fix the game nintendo  i bought it for me and my wife to enjoy i started the game first only to find out we have to share a single island  annoying but no big deal  however  i then discovered that my wife cannot make any progress in the game on her own and make and executive decisions  i was cheated out of  60 and i am pissed  fix it
795,the games fantastic  to all the people complaining about the 1 island per switch  if you were paying at least  1  of attention you would have known that  cause that was told to us multiple times i repeat multiple times  also maybe do some research before buying the game maybe  you certainly have time to write a trash review 
796,it is pretty fun  the multiplayer is lack luster but otherwise is an amazing game so far 
797,perfect game for the weird times we are in  beautiful  and filled to the brim with what ac fans would want 
798,i am sure if i was the 1st person on the island my review would be better  but as the second one all of my ability to progress is gated by my girlfriend   unless you are the first profile to log in  the game is pretty busted and quite boring unless you live alone  i would strongly recommend sitting this one out until they fix this issue in a patch  if at all 
799,now the whole cant make a second town is weird but thats how the gamecube one was and ds one but you could buy memory cards on gcn for cheeper my problem is i cant change the time of day im a secupond shifter and i cant use nooks and crannies ever for full pricw or buy shot becuase my job keeps me to late  at first you could sell to tommy in the tent all  ight but once you upgrade say byenow the whole cant make a second town is weird but thats how the gamecube one was and ds one but you could buy memory cards on gcn for cheeper my problem is i cant change the time of day im a secupond shifter and i cant use nooks and crannies ever for full pricw or buy shot becuase my job keeps me to late  at first you could sell to tommy in the tent all  ight but once you upgrade say bye bye to doing anything at night  expand
800,what is your problem gamers  it is not supposed to be a game of criticism but a game of coming together  if you wouldont like how one person decorates your island you work on a compromise  it is a mighty fine game with excellent music that proves that if it isnt broken dont break it  it is the players that need to get their act straight
801,the game is absolutely great  the only reason it has a lowish score is because the multiplayer is a little bad  but if one thing is wrong with a beautiful game it does not  mean it deserves a score of 0 
802,nunca me había comprado algún animal crossing y ahora con este que me costó encontrarlo físico por el virus en coronado xd  me a gusta bastante  es hora del súper farmeo  bien tranquilo y ya me voy porqué seguiré con este juego
803,if you like animal crossing  get it  if you think you might like it  you will
804,this is an exceedingly polished  fun  soothing  creative  and deep game  it gives much of the satisfaction from growing and harvesting and collecting i got from stardew valley  but with a much lower challenge level  cuter graphics  and none of the anxiety   i love stardew valley  so that s definitely not a knock on it there are some convoluted and annoying issues with the multiplayer this is an exceedingly polished  fun  soothing  creative  and deep game  it gives much of the satisfaction from growing and harvesting and collecting i got from stardew valley  but with a much lower challenge level  cuter graphics  and none of the anxiety   i love stardew valley  so that s definitely not a knock on it there are some convoluted and annoying issues with the multiplayer  but nothing game breaking  and it just came out so there is potential for them to be ironed out  text communication is clunky and slow  it is not intuitive how to visit or be visited by friends  and i wouldo not know why i cannot place items when someone is visiting my island  but again  this is a great game  and these are minor quibbles  expand
805,un juego excelente lleno de detalles de cosas por hacer algo sumamente adictivo por el cual a veces juegas horas y horas sin parar sin duda uno de los mejores juegos de la decada un excelente trabajo de nintendo me encantò 
806,this game is so good it got my wife excited to play it  i had to go buy her a switch but hey  i have wanted her to have her own for a while 
807,this game is honestly the best animal crossing game ever made and i have been playing since the gamecube  yes the multiplayer is a little lackluster but you all should just be glad it is even there  as far as i know all the other animal crossing games were single player  if you are a big animal crossing fan you will love this game 
808,10 10 the best animal crossing game so far  even with the one island per switch  there is so much to do and it is so gorgeous  it does not matter  the crafting gives you more to do in a day  the graphics are literally jaw dropping  the music is soothing  the chill is palpable  thank you nintendo  this is nothe animal crossing we have been waiting for 
809,new horizons did just that  opened up new horizons for the animal crossing series  the new crafting aspect was something i originally was not sure i was going to like but i have taken to and really enjoy  previous titles would just have you wouldoing tasks for your villagers and just catching bugs and fish all day long  new leaf turned a new leaf making you the mayor of a town and setting up anew horizons did just that  opened up new horizons for the animal crossing series  the new crafting aspect was something i originally was not sure i was going to like but i have taken to and really enjoy  previous titles would just have you wouldoing tasks for your villagers and just catching bugs and fish all day long  new leaf turned a new leaf making you the mayor of a town and setting up a beautiful location  now you ve got the full reign of the island to make it whatever you want  having the ability to place villager homes so they do not ruin your flower garden or paths  yes please  being able to terraform the land water scape to make it flow however you want and fill in weird gaps of the map  i ll take it  there is so much to this game that is absolutely amazing and a labor of love from nintendo socially it does require nintendo online to visit your friends  that s pretty common at this point for most game titles for any platform  i find having one island per switch to be amazing  you can share your game cartridge and not worry about someone destroying your hard work when you get it back my boyfriend and i wouldo have our own switches so it makes playing easy but i would want to get another game so i wouldo not have to wait for him when i think of a new task for myself  overall  this is a much needed island vacation  expand
810,i am a newbie to animal crossing  this is nothe first one i have ever played  i had a few close friends recommend the series to me and oh boy  i am regretting not getting it isooner  i find it iso relaxing and addictive  if you need to escape from things for a bit  then this game is definitely for you 
811, epicwin this game is everything we love about the franchise and much more 
812,love this game  it is pretty different from the previous titles but i think it is quite refreshing 
813,a near perfect implementation of a classic series  this is an early review but so far the game has everything you ve come to love in the series with new features added to help keep you engaged in the game quality of life improvements were implemented such as icons notifying you if an item has been donated to the museum already though i wouldo wish that feature was extended to all items ina near perfect implementation of a classic series  this is an early review but so far the game has everything you ve come to love in the series with new features added to help keep you engaged in the game quality of life improvements were implemented such as icons notifying you if an item has been donated to the museum already though i wouldo wish that feature was extended to all items in general to make it easier to determine what you already have in your catalog  one common complaint i hear echoed is nothe fact that you can only have one island per system cartridge but that is only a minor issue  especially with the lower cost of a switch lite  one would not expect to share one cartridge and one 3ds and have multiple towns with new leaf  so this expectation for the nintendo switch is pretty entitled  my wife and i as well as our two children play happily on our own consoles and enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game  though i wouldo hope to be surprised eventually to find minigames like tortimer island had  expand
814,y all obviously never played animal crossing it is always been one village per island now you have an option to go to other islands to get supplies  this is one of the most polished of the series  if every person got their way animal crossing would be like every other farming game good job nintendo   suck it y all spoiled haters
815,i am a long time fan of the animal crossing series and this is by far my favorite  the crafting system is awesome and the ability to have 8 players on a single island is awesome  it iseems a lot of people do not get the community aspect of this series  and want to complain about the single island per console deal  i can understand why you would want the option to make a brand new save withouti am a long time fan of the animal crossing series and this is by far my favorite  the crafting system is awesome and the ability to have 8 players on a single island is awesome  it iseems a lot of people do not get the community aspect of this series  and want to complain about the single island per console deal  i can understand why you would want the option to make a brand new save without loosing your original  but to complain that you and your wife cant have seperate islands  really misses the point of this long standing series  why wouldnt you want to share an island with your wife or kids  thats the point  everyone gets to participate together  to create an awesome island that can be built over  literally  years  my wife and i work together to create a happy and healthy community  you cannoterraform the terrain  craft new items  work together to populate the museum  and more  this is a community building game  the only improvment i would have liked is for everyone in a multiplayer session to have imidiate access to their items without having to switch leaders  the fact you can only have one island per system isnt a deal breaker  at all  people want to think that nintendo did this solely for the purposes of selling more switches  but the way i see it  this is more of a system built to prevent exploiting the game  as i recall  the only game that didnt limit the number of islands per console was the original  and that worked cuz the online capabilitiesof the game cube were very limited  even the ds games worked like this  and sure  it would have been cool if they could have solved this in a different way but the switch doesnt save to the game cartridge  they are read only memory cards  so your island must be tied to your internal storage of the switch  if everyone could make multiple islands  then the game would be very exploitable  i wish that nintendo could have solved this problem while still allowing multiple islands  or at least one island per account  but then anyone could make multiple accounts and create  but in new leaf  i wouldidnt see nearly as much hate for the fact that you had to buy the game twice to make a new file  and like i said  switch carts are read only  so the game save has to be tied to the console  they could have done cloud storage  but that would mean any user without a subscription is locked out of the game  if ni te di really wanted to milk their customers  they would ha e provided all the tools and recipies and exclusive tools and recipes  for purchase online  but no  you get the whole game and never have to pay another cent to enjoy it  expand

819,i was going to rate this a solid 8 but people are being fat basement nerd ragers and review bombing a game for no real reason again  i certainly do not see any microtransactions at least  people need to stop review bombing every tiny insignificant little thing otherwise no one is going to pay attention to them anymoreit is a great animal crossing game  if you enjoy the previous games thani was going to rate this a solid 8 but people are being fat basement nerd ragers and review bombing a game for no real reason again  i certainly do not see any microtransactions at least  people need to stop review bombing every tiny insignificant little thing otherwise no one is going to pay attention to them anymoreit is a great animal crossing game  if you enjoy the previous games than this is better  expand
820,if you have multiple people in your household you need more than one switch to play as it is 1 world per system 
821,i had never played ac before and got it for my girlfriend so she could play it on our switch because she loved playing new leaf  after she stopped playing for the day i was gonna hop on and create my own island but that s when i learned that it was not possible  there is only one island per switch console  not per user profile  even if you wouldo go ahead and use the same island you arei had never played ac before and got it for my girlfriend so she could play it on our switch because she loved playing new leaf  after she stopped playing for the day i was gonna hop on and create my own island but that s when i learned that it was not possible  there is only one island per switch console  not per user profile  even if you wouldo go ahead and use the same island you are completely gutted of what you can do as the second player  i could ve been an animal crossing fan but instead i have been alienated  i wanted to have my own island and have my own experience  a pretty disappointing flaw that only seems like a cash grab from nintendo  expand
822,graphics like this in 2020  not acceptable plus all the anti consumer stuff is just the icing on the cake  trash 
823,seems like people are hating on a nintendo exclusive game again  this is nothe perfect game of you just want to vibe  sure  you have to put in a little time before you can fully experience the game  but i think that adds to the experience  i love this game  not only that  but it came at the perfect time 
824,i have been looking forward to this game for a long time  i am not too fussed about the one island per switch thing  it keeps the game true to it is original  i remember when you could only have one house per game  and only four players   such an improvement  now we can have 8 players and 8 houses  awesome   looking forward to the seasonal events and setting up my little village
825,only one island per console is a huge drawback for me  i expected more freedom from the series  debut on the switch  i hope nintendo solves this problem with a patch in the near future 
826,more of the same great  relaxing  easy going progression that we have come to expect from the series  i wouldo wish we had the ability to create more than one island per switch but it is far from the tragic scenario that other reviewers are making it out to be update   after playing through quite a few more hours  the family is nothoroughly irritated at the fact that our 6 year old is nothe kid withmore of the same great  relaxing  easy going progression that we have come to expect from the series  i wouldo wish we had the ability to create more than one island per switch but it is far from the tragic scenario that other reviewers are making it out to be update   after playing through quite a few more hours  the family is nothoroughly irritated at the fact that our 6 year old is nothe kid with the dominant profile which is limiting all of our progression  nintendo  this has to be patched so we can populate different islands with multiple profiles using a single switch  expand

830,made an account just to review this game to help raise awarness and hopefully get this fixed  the reason i say fixed is because it is unbelievable that this was the intention of the developers and nintendo  the game is great as a single player experience  even sitting around watching my girlfriend play is a fun time and helping her out by grabbing the controller to help hermade an account just to review this game to help raise awarness and hopefully get this fixed  the reason i say fixed is because it is unbelievable that this was the intention of the developers and nintendo  the game is great as a single player experience  even sitting around watching my girlfriend play is a fun time and helping her out by grabbing the controller to help her progress everything changes though when you want to try having your own animal crossing experience on your account  the game locks you into one island per switch  so whatever creative descisions the first player made is stripped from the second player you cannot place buildings or structures  donate to the museum  or unlock more diy tools or construction kits  you are locked by the progress of the first player  even though you are on a completely different profile  the only way out of this is noto give nintendo more money by purchasing a new switch console  yes thats right  want the full experience of this game for yourself but cannot because someone started playing the game on the switch first  for the mere price of a whole new console you can have that  60 on release game experience for only about 5x the cost of the game originally  thanks nintendo  you have basically locked the gane into being a hard 1 game per console and advertising it as a fun multiplayer experience where everyone gets to help make an island together  instead you have that experience for only one player and all the other accounts on your console are just along for the ride  no one should have to suffer a paywall this high  poor business practices and this game deserves every negative rating it gets until this is fixed  0 10 a masterpiece only 1 person in your household can enjoy  expand

834,i love the new animal crossing  you have always been made to share a town with others in your home  i wouldo not understand the haters  thumbs up from me 
835,it is an awesome game  i am playing with my girlfriend  all in the same island and we are loving it to pieces 
836,game is great  i literally cannot stop play it lol  the people purposely leaving horrible reviews over one or two things that can be changed with updates and ignoring everything good the game has to offer are simply being immature

843,i hate cry babies reviews bombing  but by the way it is a good game in my humble opinion 
844,i started this game without great expectations  and it ended up being an extremely relaxing experience you will not be able to do everything in one day  the game waits for you to come in daily and connect to play  for this reason i highly recommend having a digital version the issue of having only one island per console takes away some points  but in my case i wouldo not share my consolei started this game without great expectations  and it ended up being an extremely relaxing experience you will not be able to do everything in one day  the game waits for you to come in daily and connect to play  for this reason i highly recommend having a digital version the issue of having only one island per console takes away some points  but in my case i wouldo not share my console with other people because it is not a problem if you are in quarantine like i recommend i take a look at this game  expand

846,a fantastically relaxing game that is super engrossing  i recommend having other games to play while you wait for things to be built because half the fun of the game is feeling that the island is actually alive with real events that take time  on the box of the game  it tell you how only one island is allowed per console  review bombing the game over something that is displayed on the box a fantastically relaxing game that is super engrossing  i recommend having other games to play while you wait for things to be built because half the fun of the game is feeling that the island is actually alive with real events that take time  on the box of the game  it tell you how only one island is allowed per console  review bombing the game over something that is displayed on the box  isnt a fair  definitely hope this issue is fixed  but as someone who plays alone on my console  it is not worth ignoring how great the game is  expand
847,first of all its worth pointing out that this is in fact an animal crossing game  you either  get it or you wouldo not  animal crossing is a gentle life simulator and relaxation game  it is not for everybody   that said  like each new main release in the series this one is nothe best animal crossing yet  if you like animals crossing you wouldo not need anyone to tell you whether or not to buy it  youfirst of all its worth pointing out that this is in fact an animal crossing game  you either  get it or you wouldo not  animal crossing is a gentle life simulator and relaxation game  it is not for everybody   that said  like each new main release in the series this one is nothe best animal crossing yet  if you like animals crossing you wouldo not need anyone to tell you whether or not to buy it  you wanna get this game  expand
848,the fact that i cannot buy two different games at least to have a different island than the rest of my family is ridiculous  i would not mind sharing if it was not so only the first player gets to upgrade things  it is disgusting because i have been sitting with an underdeveloped island for days while my younger sibling got the favoritism of my parents so they were allowed to make the firstthe fact that i cannot buy two different games at least to have a different island than the rest of my family is ridiculous  i would not mind sharing if it was not so only the first player gets to upgrade things  it is disgusting because i have been sitting with an underdeveloped island for days while my younger sibling got the favoritism of my parents so they were allowed to make the first character and now the villagers have been in tents for 5 days  all because they do not want to play as often as they acted like they would  so now i am stuck on an island with no stores because the first relocater hasn t supplied building materials  i am about to lose my mind  for the love of god at least change it iso if i throw money at nintendo and buy another copy of the game i can have a new island  expand
849,honestly the game is amazing  while i understand that the one island per console might bother some people  if you play couch coop can be a blast  there is also tons of trolls review bombing the game instead of doing fair criticism also  but is hard to deny that it is nothe best animal crossing by far 
850,back in my day you got one town and you liked it  learn to share with the people you live with 
851,amazing game  animal crossing has always been about multiple people all working together to make your town better  people complaining about only getting one island are missing what animal crossing is about 
852,uh oh looks like nintendo forgot to put a game in their game to be fair  you can spend 4 years snorting coke and make the game in the last 6 weeks dunkey
853,this is animal crossing  people that are complaining  just bought this game because everyone else was buying it and did not do any research about the style of game  it was advertised it was 1 island per switch  yes you have to wait real world days for stuff to progress because it is animal crossing  it is like you bought doom eternal expecting there to be a deep woven narrative with heavythis is animal crossing  people that are complaining  just bought this game because everyone else was buying it and did not do any research about the style of game  it was advertised it was 1 island per switch  yes you have to wait real world days for stuff to progress because it is animal crossing  it is like you bought doom eternal expecting there to be a deep woven narrative with heavy dialogue and character building  actual game score 8 10  expand

856,amazing game  all the people review bombing are just entitled children do not let there review sway your decision to buy this awesome game 
857,good stuff  no idea why it is currently at a 6 5 y all stay mad  anyways chillie
858,brilliant game  true to the animal crossing series while trying out some fresh and effective mechanics such as crafting and terraforming  do not listen to people who are giving this game 0 stars  they re just salty that you can only have one island per switch 
859,to say that  co op is noterrible  or that the game isn t fair  simply means that you are not putting in the effort to enjoy the game  player 2  if you are coming into the game expecting that you will be able to do so so much  you wont  just like player 1  they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you are complaining about i understand the one island perto say that  co op is noterrible  or that the game isn t fair  simply means that you are not putting in the effort to enjoy the game  player 2  if you are coming into the game expecting that you will be able to do so so much  you wont  just like player 1  they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you are complaining about i understand the one island per switch  but there is two reasons for this first  an island takes up a significant amount of space on your switch  with the addition of progression and adding items to your inventory  and your museum and encyclopedia  that all adds up  then imagine every user on a switch  8 users with their own individual islands  on top of that per user  7 additional houses per shared island  that s a grand total of 8 unique islands  and 64 unique players  that amount of data adds up  quickly secondly  adding onto the data situation  the game allows 8 users total on an island  if you are playing online  the max is 8 on your island total  given the switch has a total of 8 users  its the best choice to make  one island per switch  one player per user to review bomb a game means you are not taking time to understand and come to terms why the game is built like this overall  in my opinion  the game is a 10  with future dlc  it will bump it to an 11  expand

862,awesome game     the best animal crossing so far 
863,really great game as always  the negative commentators are just   i like everything they updated
864,all of the negative reviews are from people that are not familiar with the animal crossing franchise  let me preface this by saying that in animal crossing  it was always 1 town per console from gamecube to now  also  animal crossing never gave clear objectives because it is a do what you want when you want kind of game   extremely casual  you can access your objectives through your nookall of the negative reviews are from people that are not familiar with the animal crossing franchise  let me preface this by saying that in animal crossing  it was always 1 town per console from gamecube to now  also  animal crossing never gave clear objectives because it is a do what you want when you want kind of game   extremely casual  you can access your objectives through your nook phone though and they are laid out for you  and all are pretty much optional to complete  honestly this is a game that long time fans of the series will love  as well as fans of the mobile game pocket camp  it is very open and do as you wish  which animal crossing has always kind of been like that  if you like stardew valley  you will probably like this game also  expand
865,suddenly everyone wants to play with more than one island on a switch  5 hours into the game and the game is fun  relaxing and i always find something to do great game that does not deserve the 0 peole that maybe havent even play the game yet 
866,todos los que le ponen menos de 8 a este juego  déjenme decirles que su opinión vale callampa y que a nadie le importa xd
867,i love this game and its so fun and it is even better seeing it on your tv  the people who are complaining about this game only having one island for one switch  it is like that on new leaf too   stop your complaining and go buy another switch for all the people in your family   i am gonna enjoy every minute of this game as well as all the nice graphics and playing with my friends 
868,taking animal crossing to new heights  yes  there are some limitations  like only having one island per switch  but the amazing gameplay offered here more than makes up for that  and let us be honest  this is not an evil nintendo scheme to sell more consoles  it is a classic nintendo limitation to make players play and have fun together  which is actually working really well in my household 
869,the best animal crossing yet  ignore all the 0s  it is a bunch of children   about one or two features instead of calmly and reasonably reviewing the game in totality 
870,one island per console means everyone in the household should buy a switch right now and you might as well buy more controllers just for the heck of it cause you know they gonna go bad  if you wanna play a good quality game nintendo is nothe way to go  but god dang have fun running around with your kid being able to do nothing they can   no split iscreen or shared content at all 
871,if you aread any of the other mixed or negative reviews on this site  you will see many people primarily complaining about being locked to one island per switch and having content restricted if they re not their not the first person to play   i have made a petition hoping to remedy some of these issues  link is http chng it kdmvhypxevery signature helps  so please sign and share thanks 
872,i have found the hours of my days devoured by this game in a way that i have not seen happen for quite some time  honestly i was unsure if i even enjoyed games anymore but having grown up semi frequently playing the game predecessors i wouldecided to give it a go and i am glad i wouldid  please get this game it is amazing 
873,this is a rather early on review  as i have been playing for 4 days and i am sure a lot is subject to change  there are a lot of great improvements from older versions of the game  but unfortunately a lot is lacking  which takes away from the overall gameplay  i will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect  as i am playing alone on my switch  and am not encountering problems  though i canthis is a rather early on review  as i have been playing for 4 days and i am sure a lot is subject to change  there are a lot of great improvements from older versions of the game  but unfortunately a lot is lacking  which takes away from the overall gameplay  i will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect  as i am playing alone on my switch  and am not encountering problems  though i cannototally understand the frustration of those who have to share a console island  the game is built unfairly for those people the game does not have hourly music  which is something previous animal crossing games are known for  i amiss having quirky  hourly tracks  but the backtrack gets repetitive very quickly  the objective based system is a nice touch  but unfortunately does not feel rewarding  and does not lead to any larger objective  gyroids also are not present in the game  and i really hope they come out with an update the game has a slow paced system  which is ok and echoes the animal crossing feel  but the delay of introducing characters villagers buildings etc leads to a heavy lack in content  who knows  maybe they were not expecting people to have so much time due to the corona lockdown  i am a bit disappointed that i am already starting to feel bored after 4 days  especially when the game has been in the making for such a long amount of time i am hoping a lot of these problems will be fixed by either playing the game for a longer period of time  or updates  i am hoping nintendo will not push heavy paid dlc packages for this game  expand

875,new horizons has everything that made new leaf great  and then some  its cute  fun  addicting  and charming  the main complaint that i see from people is nothat you are limited to 1 island per console  animal crossing has always been like this from day 1 and is nothing new  so it really should not be a surprise  overall the game is fantastic and i cant wait to see whats in store for thenew horizons has everything that made new leaf great  and then some  its cute  fun  addicting  and charming  the main complaint that i see from people is nothat you are limited to 1 island per console  animal crossing has always been like this from day 1 and is nothing new  so it really should not be a surprise  overall the game is fantastic and i cant wait to see whats in store for the seasons and events  expand
876,i cannot stress enough how dumb half these reviews are  the fact that most of these reviews tunnel vision on only the 1 island rule set is absurd  this is why a lot of user reviews are dismissed purely because of this i for one do not seem phased by this  neither do a few of my other friends  besides the fact  the game s mechanics feel smooth and easygoing  i like the progress of thei cannot stress enough how dumb half these reviews are  the fact that most of these reviews tunnel vision on only the 1 island rule set is absurd  this is why a lot of user reviews are dismissed purely because of this i for one do not seem phased by this  neither do a few of my other friends  besides the fact  the game s mechanics feel smooth and easygoing  i like the progress of the story is provides  and the progression of the island over time  if i were going to complain about a missing feature though  is nothe fact that multi select is not a thing when it comes to putting stuff away in your home storage  other than that  the game feels very well done in spite of all the negative reviews it has i feel like nintendo will fix this just to mitigate the number of complaints people are throwing at them  but this will not stop people from attacking it from base release  expand
877,this is a great game  it is super relaxing and fun to play  it is cool that you can craft items in this game  i wouldo not get why people are complaing about how only the one person can do certain things on the island since most of the previous games were like this  in the 3ds only the one player was the mayor  so this was not really a surprise 
878,only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff  the other players on the island cannot contribute and can only really gather resources  this limits every other player than the 1st one and really blows  i hope nintendo fixes this 
879,yes the decision to allow only one island per switch is silly  but that does not mean the game is an automatic 0  animal crossing was always like this anyway  the game starts a bit islow  but there is still plenty to do thanks to the new feature of nook miles the game has plenty of content and features new to the series  but but none feel out of place in the world of animal crossing  animalyes the decision to allow only one island per switch is silly  but that does not mean the game is an automatic 0  animal crossing was always like this anyway  the game starts a bit islow  but there is still plenty to do thanks to the new feature of nook miles the game has plenty of content and features new to the series  but but none feel out of place in the world of animal crossing  animal crossing new horizons is something that both longtime fans and newcomers to the series can enjoy  expand

881,if you have 2 kids  or more  and they both want to play this game in a peacefull democratc way  then do not buy this game  you can only create 1 island  the first player that creates this island   boss in other words this game is created for 1 player or for households with multiple nintendo switches 
882,amazing new addition to the already awesome series  i love how much work the dev and design teams have put towards this game  it is notruly a labour of love  wonderful graphics  new dialogue  new villagers  new concepts  crafting  and improvements on existing concepts such as house decor  outfits  etc 
883,this is nothe best game of the series  it combines all of the best elements of the previous games and whips them into something magical  while still introducing new elements to create an overall fantastic game  it is also extremely aesthetically pleasing to look at  which is a huge plus  i bought the game the day it came out and cannot stop playing  while other games in the series i couldthis is nothe best game of the series  it combines all of the best elements of the previous games and whips them into something magical  while still introducing new elements to create an overall fantastic game  it is also extremely aesthetically pleasing to look at  which is a huge plus  i bought the game the day it came out and cannot stop playing  while other games in the series i could only play for about 30 minutes out of the day before feeling bored or like there was nothing to do  i find myself playing this one for hours and still feeling like i could do more  overall  amazing game  and i cannot wait to play it for years to come  expand
884,just about the happiest game available right now  the game continues with the cute ac style from all the other games  but gives you loads more options to customise your characters face  hair and outfit  it combines some of the home design from hhd and the crafting element of pocket camp to make the game different enough from its predecessors  it is a tad monotonous at times  just like alljust about the happiest game available right now  the game continues with the cute ac style from all the other games  but gives you loads more options to customise your characters face  hair and outfit  it combines some of the home design from hhd and the crafting element of pocket camp to make the game different enough from its predecessors  it is a tad monotonous at times  just like all the ac games  but it is the perfect way to kill time while the world s on lock down  you can only have 1 town per switch  but that s the same as all the previous ac games  like new leaf and wild world  there is always pleanty to do  but you can play at your own speed  getting lots done every day  or hardly anything at all  expand
885,an excellent addition to the animal crossing library  gorgeous graphics and sound design  nostalgic  but with many new things to explore

887,really fun game  an update on the older games while keeping the charm of the series 
888,animal crossing is an experience which is definitely not for everyone  the game has charming graphics and calming sound effects  music  the gameplay is amazing and from what i have seen this is in my opinion the best animal crossing game  i would give this a 10 10 if did not handle save file recovery like this  i really wish that i could back up my saves to the cloud so if i lost my switchanimal crossing is an experience which is definitely not for everyone  the game has charming graphics and calming sound effects  music  the gameplay is amazing and from what i have seen this is in my opinion the best animal crossing game  i would give this a 10 10 if did not handle save file recovery like this  i really wish that i could back up my saves to the cloud so if i lost my switch i would not need to hope that nintendo accepts my one time save file recovery proposal  i have not lost my switch once  but i really do not wanna risk it  i see a lot of people giving this game awful reviews just because you can only have one island per console  grow up  i understand that some people might want more consoles if their entire family plays on the console  but please do not give the game 1 10 reviews only for that  as this is my first animal crossing game i can surely say that it is 100  worth the price  but just keep in mind that it is not for everyone  expand
889,everything i have ever wanted from an animal crossing game  this island is my own  through and through  yes it is a shame there is only one island per console  but that does not take  this game from a 9 to a 1 
890,it is a very good and calm game  i love the graphics  finally in hd  the bad thing is nothat you only have one island per switch and it does not have a split iscreen  it is a shame  but there is notime to improve it  i think if you like quiet games or are a fan of the saga  this will be your favorite 
891,more of 7 1 2 than an 8 i have always loved the animal crossing series  but of course there are always some kind of problems  its nintendo  we all know that they make a lot of decisions because they want that   we still give in and buy the games anyway  that being said here is some things i found wrong 1st  the one island per switch situation  we all know about it by now  we allmore of 7 1 2 than an 8 i have always loved the animal crossing series  but of course there are always some kind of problems  its nintendo  we all know that they make a lot of decisions because they want that   we still give in and buy the games anyway  that being said here is some things i found wrong 1st  the one island per switch situation  we all know about it by now  we all dislike that decision  i am not gonna go in on how dumb that is  especially since i am one of the lucky house holds with 2 switches  2nd  you cannot go on the mystery island tours with local or online players  one of my friends and i s favorite part of new leaf was going on the island tours together  felt like this is notaking a step backwards 3rd  we still cannot kick out villagers once they moved in  just like new leaf you have to wait for the villager to make the suggestion to move  then say ok  which sucks  cuz when nook gives you the task of placing the 3 houses for the new comers  you wouldo not know who it will be until after you ve finished making the furniture for said villagers   snooty jerks should start out in tents like the rest of us btw  but that s another topic all together  that is unless you had the nook miles to fly to 3 islands  happen to come across and convince 3 villagers you actually want to move into your island  b4 the task was given  then and only then will you know who s moving in  which feels like a slap in the face  since nintendo advertised this game to let us pick and choose villagers 24 7 4th  not being able to relocate the plaza  airport  river openings and the mineable rocks  dont have to explain why this is flawed 5th  the museum dosent give you explanations on the bugs  fish or fossils once you found all the peices  in new leaf  once you wouldonated something you can go in and read up a little info on what you found  now you just look it up on your collections app or blathers cannotell you about the bug fish fossils you find  if you have it in your inventory  again felt like a step backwards 6th  took away the choice of what room to build  in new leaf you can choose what rooms to build in your home  my old house had only the back room  attic and basement done  i wanted to recreate that house  only for nook to tell me that the back room was going to be made frist  then the side room again step backwards 7th  not being able to put qr designs on all furniture items  also some items not being customizable at all  example  fence that i wish i could paint white  instead of buying the specific white version  or wanting to put a custom color on the bed frame  not just the sheets 8th  no way to load your self made qr designs  from new leaf happy home  to the switch  if you aremembered to take a picture of every qr code for every design you made  congratulations  you can use the nintendo app and download a non editable version onto the switch if you have nintendo online  locking  what was free in the last series  behind a paywall now is just shameful  people would have gotten nintendo online for the ability to visit friends islands as it is  which leads me to the final complaint you know what really would have made people want to get nintendo online for this game  cloud saves  they took away cloud saves to stop cheaters  yet people found a money glitch litterly on the release date but if you look past all these frustrations  the game is very relaxing and a fun time waster  a lot of these problems could be fixed with an update  so who knows what the future holds  expand

895,while i totally agree that only allowing one island per switch is a garbage move by nintendo  everything else about this game is a 10 10 
896,this game is nothe culmination of all the previous versions in one  it is perfect a game and i cannot think of the developers enough  some people are complaining that there is no goals  when you are daily tasks and goals are rewarded with nook points to keep you motivated  the whole point to this game is noto relax  enjoy and do whatever you want to a deserted island to make it feel like home tothis game is nothe culmination of all the previous versions in one  it is perfect a game and i cannot think of the developers enough  some people are complaining that there is no goals  when you are daily tasks and goals are rewarded with nook points to keep you motivated  the whole point to this game is noto relax  enjoy and do whatever you want to a deserted island to make it feel like home to you  craft furniture  fly to other islands  have mega 8 player party popper fests with a voice chat feature through your phone  amazing  are there isome flaws  yes  but every game does  people who are rating it zero do not know what their talking about  i highly recommend this game for it just being so pure and wholesome and just so enjoyable  expand
897,honestly a lovely game  i understand frustrations with the island restrictions  but this game is still a 10 10 for me  it is not a game you win  just a game you play  which often is just what i need if you need a relaxing  psuedo life sim  this is your game 
898,this game is fantastic  what else can i say  it runs well on the switch  the only issue that i have is nothat apparently the fishing tourney is notimed to just 3 minutes  that sucks  but i think i can get over it   d

902,great game and the issue people have with multiplayer is ridiculous  there are so many reasons why that is nothe case to share an island  also it is not that big of a deal to share  the whole point of the game is noto have fun and people are taking it too seriously  enjoy it for what it is  a game and do not get hung up on the fact that you need to actually play it to get the resources you want

922,overall a great game so far but every player should be able to create unlimited islands  at least one for every local player 
923,this game is really well made and deserve to be played  i love every detail but i wish you could do something more in the online multiplayer
924,most of the negatives that are mentioned in some reviews here do not apply to me  because i am the only one using my switch to play that particular game  i wouldo understand though  that it must be upsetting for people with family in the household and one switch device  and now they cannot all enjoy the game the way they thought  to me  the game is almost perfect  the only thing that keeps memost of the negatives that are mentioned in some reviews here do not apply to me  because i am the only one using my switch to play that particular game  i wouldo understand though  that it must be upsetting for people with family in the household and one switch device  and now they cannot all enjoy the game the way they thought  to me  the game is almost perfect  the only thing that keeps me from giving this game a perfect score is nothe still not resolved issue with the cloud save option  considering that animal crossing is a game that many people play for years  it would be terrible to lose all of the progress when your switch gets damaged lost or you simply would love to get a different switch console other than that  it is a incredibly cute game that keeps me wanting to go back and play every day  which i was not expecting  since this is my first animal crossing game i have ever played  expand
925,animal crossing has of course improved itself with this new entry  new features like crafting  quick customisation  and being able to place furniture outside is amazing  and with qol  quality of life  improvements  like the ability to expand your inventory and having resources automatically stack  i cannot help but recommend anyone who has a switch to buy this game the only thing thatanimal crossing has of course improved itself with this new entry  new features like crafting  quick customisation  and being able to place furniture outside is amazing  and with qol  quality of life  improvements  like the ability to expand your inventory and having resources automatically stack  i cannot help but recommend anyone who has a switch to buy this game the only thing that stops me from giving a 10 is sadly the same switch multiplayer  and the concept of it in its entirety  having multiple villagers on one island  only one can experience the full game  but also stops others from getting further  this gives other players the feeling that they are missing 20  of the experience  from an other players  perspective  this isn t great  and the only thing that would make me happy is noto just give each player an option to either join an existing island  or create a new one also with couch co op  please allow followers to use the favourites wheel  expand
926,totally unfair that users are slamming this game with a 0 10 review for the 1 island per console issue  yes  it really does suck  it is a pain and it does somewhat diminish the enjoyment of the game  but there are so many amazing facets of the game  the detail  the nook miles system  the nook phone  the creative ways they snuck in old themes  dodo airlines in place of tortimer    they aretotally unfair that users are slamming this game with a 0 10 review for the 1 island per console issue  yes  it really does suck  it is a pain and it does somewhat diminish the enjoyment of the game  but there are so many amazing facets of the game  the detail  the nook miles system  the nook phone  the creative ways they snuck in old themes  dodo airlines in place of tortimer    they are worth at least a few points  do not drag down a beautiful game with a 0 10 rating for one issue  even if it is worth the loss of a couple points  expand

928,a very cute and refreshing animal crossing game  it offers beautiful graphics and motivation through setting your own goals  especially with the nook miles  offers many improvements like the tool ring the only thing i need to complain is nothe long tutorial phase  it could be a little bit boring and during this notime  you will hear the same bgm  also i have the feeling the animala very cute and refreshing animal crossing game  it offers beautiful graphics and motivation through setting your own goals  especially with the nook miles  offers many improvements like the tool ring the only thing i need to complain is nothe long tutorial phase  it could be a little bit boring and during this notime  you will hear the same bgm  also i have the feeling the animal villagers are a little bit dull and are annoyed very fast and there are some things i am missing like the cafe  i hope they will improve  villagers dialogues  and add those things in an update in overall  it is a lovely new animal crossing with some flaws  it was worth the long wait  i wouldo not understand the negative review bomb  it was known for a long time that you can have one island per console   shrug  expand

931,where do i even begin with this game  animal crossing  new horizons is nothe first animal crossing title i have ever played and i am loving every bit of it  i used to be one to shy away from the series because i felt it was not a game for me  but boy was i wrong  everything about the game is exciting and there is so much to do every new day you boot the game up  you start the game off as awhere do i even begin with this game  animal crossing  new horizons is nothe first animal crossing title i have ever played and i am loving every bit of it  i used to be one to shy away from the series because i felt it was not a game for me  but boy was i wrong  everything about the game is exciting and there is so much to do every new day you boot the game up  you start the game off as a villager brought to a deserted island with tom nook and a couple other of animal villagers  right off the bat  you are assigned with tasks to keep you busy for the rest of the day  from fishing  catching bugs  gathering materials  crafting items  and expanding the village  there is a lot to do on such a little island  this game could not have come out at a better time especially due to the current state of affairs  but it is a game that has had me occupied since the day it came out  visiting other friends  islands is just as fun and it is really unexplainable how great this game is  it is truly an experience everyone should enjoy  expand
932,one island per switch is dumb  wtf nintendo  i will no longer purchase games with pointless restrictions like this 
933,the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands sucks  i cannot even review the game properly because i cannot progress properly
934,it is the same experience of animal crossing but with a new crafting system that gives new possibilities to the franchise i hope it keeps improving 
935,the best game in the series ever  i love animal crossing so much  and this game but is nothe best 
936,amazing  soothing  charming  every element of this game makes me happy  and every little task  even the ones that need to be done every day  is fun or interesting  it is definitely a rewarding game  and much needed with the current state of the world 
937,amazing graphics  gameplay  and more  a great spin on other classic animal crossing games  the characters are more full of life  and there is so  much  to do  the  only  reason this game is getting negative reviews is because people are mad about some of it is multiplayer features  but nintendo made it clear how it was going to be  from the get go

940,honestly the only thing that s kept me sane through the whole corona thing  everything about the game makes me love it more  the cute new villagers  building houses for them where i want   and having so much power really is all i have wanted since i first played wild world about 15 years ago
941,imagine leaving a 0 or 1 star over one dumb thing  this game series has evolved so much since the previous ones and it has so many neat features that make the game great  such as dropping off multiple fossils at once and a lot of character customization options  and the graphics are amazing  you are all just a bunch of angry karens
942,this is just the game the world needed  i could not be more grateful to nintendo for bringing back their best series for disassociating weirdos like me at a time where we all could use a sunny vacation  thank you if you are out here being a little resetti about a switch not allowing more than one island per console  guess what buttercup  the bloody gamecube did the exact same thing  getthis is just the game the world needed  i could not be more grateful to nintendo for bringing back their best series for disassociating weirdos like me at a time where we all could use a sunny vacation  thank you if you are out here being a little resetti about a switch not allowing more than one island per console  guess what buttercup  the bloody gamecube did the exact same thing  get over yourselves and share with your friends and family  thanks  nook inc  expand

945,everything i was hoping it would be  i never rate games but the butthurt review bombing inspired me to jump in and negate at least 1 of the angry manchildren reviews  seriously though  it is embarrassing behavior 
946,anima crossing it is a very good game  only stupid people would put a 0 for silly things  also many are bots
947,i love this game  my sister and i can play together or alone  we are constantly connecting together  i was also impressed that my sister and her boyfriend could play together too  they share their island but its fun they can play at the same time  the connection is amazing  it feels like a new game but it also feels like the game i have known and loved

951,i recommend for anyone seriously on the fence about buying this game to watch the directs  spoil yourself  there is no story to animal crossing  no two playthroughs are alike  there is nothing to spoil  research and make an informed decision  i share my switch  with two other adults  they work  i wouldo not  couch co op works fine  people are upset that followers cannot talk to villagers andi recommend for anyone seriously on the fence about buying this game to watch the directs  spoil yourself  there is no story to animal crossing  no two playthroughs are alike  there is nothing to spoil  research and make an informed decision  i share my switch  with two other adults  they work  i wouldo not  couch co op works fine  people are upset that followers cannot talk to villagers and does not have an inventory while in co op mode  you can still access the tools you already had and anything you pick up enters the box in town hall  everything people are complaining about was stated in the animal crossing direct and in other information outlets before preorders were made available  and with that knowledge the complaints seem pretty unwarranted  the game itself is very cute  very animal crossing  and very easy to pick up for new players  customization is more extensive than in any previous ac game  allowing for more unique experiences in the game  online multiplayer is also super easy compared to new leaf and i find my island has become a hangout hub for all the friends who ve visited  for fellow time lords  there is also notably no and i repeat no consequence for time traveling  assuming you stop at every day on your journey  talk to every villager once per in game day  sell your turnips within the week you bought them in  and collect your bonus nook miles at the start of every day  i feel like a lot of npcs who seemed a little bland in new leaf have been revitalized in this entry  blathers especially  many npcs from past games are not present however  those who enjoyed city folk s cafe and were hoping for a return will be disappointed overall i cannot get enough of this game  there are some choices i question  not bundling a certain cutting board recipe with the ironwood kitchenette  specifically  but it is a fun game nonetheless  and i recommend it to returning fans from previous ac games  or to people who do not even play games usually  expand

955,echoing what others are saying  it is a good game but families will be in for a disappointed  i thought nintendo is a pro family company  artificially restricting others users on the same switch from creating their own world and enjoy the game to the fullest is a deal breaker  i hope they fix this soon  what a shame 
956,wtf one island  my fiance cannot even play the game as it is supposed to be and i have to deal with her stealing all my furniture 
957,disgusting practice by nintendo  i have lost all respect for this company  what a disgrace 
958,11 days after release   still cannot play the game because all switches are sold out everywhere   this one island per console joke has cost me  60 and my switch   good luck 
959,it would be a 9 10 if nintendo did not choose that i need a own switch if i want to play on my own island when 2 players want to play this game  wtf nintendo  right  no animal crossing had this before but no ds had more than 2 accounts aviable either 
960,i cannot grasp why the second player literally cannot have any fun on this game rather than be an at best shadow to the resident leader or a resource collector  it completely takes away from the experience  i bought this game for my girlfriend who is not an avid gamer  but loves the animal crossing titles  i can understand the appeal of the game and i would love to play it  but i ami cannot grasp why the second player literally cannot have any fun on this game rather than be an at best shadow to the resident leader or a resource collector  it completely takes away from the experience  i bought this game for my girlfriend who is not an avid gamer  but loves the animal crossing titles  i can understand the appeal of the game and i would love to play it  but i am basically being forced to wait for her to play  which is not nearly as often as i would like to play  please fix this issue of being player 2 it takes away from the game entirely  literally  not enjoyably if you are player 2  expand
961,the limitation of 1 island per console makes this a cash grab that ea would be proud of and ruins a perfectly great experience   nintendo needs to fix this 
962,game was great  until i realized you could only have 1 save  with progress locked to one character  so if you share your switch with other users  you are unable to make any kind of progress unless the original character has done so  nintendo expecting people to go out and buy another  300 console just for another switch is completely unacceptable 
963,hi  i am a lifelong animal crossing fan who made a metacritic account just to leave this review  i have faithfully bought every nintendo console  and every animal crossing game  and new horizons was no exception  leading up to the launch i was hesitant and skeptical  but still full of hype and excitement  as the game started nearing towards launch i started getting worried about the lack ofhi  i am a lifelong animal crossing fan who made a metacritic account just to leave this review  i have faithfully bought every nintendo console  and every animal crossing game  and new horizons was no exception  leading up to the launch i was hesitant and skeptical  but still full of hype and excitement  as the game started nearing towards launch i started getting worried about the lack of content shown  and the rumors of removing gender related content indeed it iseems both worries ended up being genuine and it turns out that new horizons has received  massive  cuts compared to older games  i ll start with my chief complaint which is nothat the ability to play as a girl has been removed entirely  at least to my knowledge  there is a gender option at the beginning of the game which does nothing  and characters misgender you aregardless of what you pick  feminine walk run animations were removed entirely  likewise all gendered comments  including compliments  were removed  the game makes no reference to gender at all to the point of misgendering people  the option is basically there to lull you into a false sense of security most of the game s content is locked behind weeks worth of waiting  which is particularly bad for an ac game but not unprecedented  the game shipped without  any  holidays  and requires online connectivity to access such content  more or less every major animal crossing character has been cut from the game  including redd  katrina  brewster  harriet  rover  kapp n  etc  despite ac usually being about freedom of choice  the game pretty much railroads you for the first several days  as opposed to the usual quick tutorial sequence  it is already been almost a week and despite going at full pace  able sisters are nowhere to be seen  they come after about 2 weeks  instead of the usual which is being there immediately patterns are back  but not the way you would like  to get full use out of it you also need a 3ds and copy of new leaf  so that you can make certain patterns inside of that game  make a qr  then get your phone  scannothe qr  making sure you pay the monthly fee for nintendo s online service  only  then  can you get every type of clothing in the pattern maker  nh lacks certain pattern options so you have to scannothem in  there  is  a few more options which is nice  but it is not as much as i would hoped art is removed entirely as redd is gone  gyroids are gone entirely the positives of the game are the nook miles system  which i was not very excited for despite it being a solid addition  and the crafting  crafting is fun  but is just the usual furniture system albeit with an extra step  collecting resources  which means the process to collect furniture is now even  slower  than before  the game is lacking in content and to make up for it they drip feed the existing content at a snails pace  much slower than previous entries i really like that you can send letters to irl friends without having to visit their town  which makes the letter sending feature actually useful  terraforming seems cool but is end game so i wouldo not have that yet  my complaint about ac  new horizons is nothe exact same complaint i had about zelda  breath of the wild  it is a great engine  but there is no game there all in all what i usually come to animal crossing for is an affirming creative space where i can be myself and talk with the virtual npcs who can act as affirming and supportive friends  you will not find that here  the villagers in game have repetitive stale dialogue  misgender you and your irl friends  and are very lacking for the first week  you only start with 2 and get a third after almost a week in  on the plus side the animations and actions they can perform are much more detailed and involved which is great all in all this feels more like an animal crossing engine with injected transphobia  sexism  and hate  if you are looking at animal crossing because it iseems like a cute welcoming game where you can get creative and relax  you are better off with new leaf  as new horizons is just kinda a let down  i know looking back i ll probably revisit nl rather than nh  perhaps i amissed something  this may be the last ac game i buy if things continue like this  expand
964,it is ridiculous that nintendo does not allow each user to have a separate island  not even buying a second cartridge works  you have to buy a second switch system for another island and that is just bs  this is even worse than ea 
965,honestly the one island per switch feature does not affect me since i am the only user of my switch  however as a matter of principle i am giving this a bad review  this is such a baffling decision by nintendo  i amean seriously  what were they thinking  this just shows how absolutely greedy they are and how little they care about their fans  with this move they basically gave a middle fingerhonestly the one island per switch feature does not affect me since i am the only user of my switch  however as a matter of principle i am giving this a bad review  this is such a baffling decision by nintendo  i amean seriously  what were they thinking  this just shows how absolutely greedy they are and how little they care about their fans  with this move they basically gave a middle finger to all of us and told us that they only care about making money  i always thought they were one of the good ones  but after this i am reconsidering that position  shame on you nintendo  expand
966,if you have more than one person in your house that wants to play this game  do not bother  you are not only locked to one island per game console  but player 2 is progression locked behind player 1 and cannot do any story activities at all  and they also cannot get any tools unless player one has them already  they also cannot get any tools the first player did not already get if you have more than one person in your house that wants to play this game  do not bother  you are not only locked to one island per game console  but player 2 is progression locked behind player 1 and cannot do any story activities at all  and they also cannot get any tools unless player one has them already  they also cannot get any tools the first player did not already get essentially  if you are player two you cannot even really play the game  there is absolutely no reason for it to work this way  as evidenced by the ability to have multiple profiles in the latest pokemon games  expand
967,me and my gf sharing one island the fact that only one player is a full citizen ruin the whole experience 
968,this game is meant to be a household game where multiple people can play on the same island town without hindered progress and etc  the current state of the game makes the second person on the island unable to progress through the game as well as limitations on what you can place do  this is nothe last thing any of us wanted and has ruined the experience for me  this is a huge issue that ithis game is meant to be a household game where multiple people can play on the same island town without hindered progress and etc  the current state of the game makes the second person on the island unable to progress through the game as well as limitations on what you can place do  this is nothe last thing any of us wanted and has ruined the experience for me  this is a huge issue that i have no idea why it even got through the testing phase  change this nintendo or else i will not be purchasing dlc nor continue playing this game  expand
969,im sorry but its total bs to just have one island  otherwise the game is perfect
970,this game would be so close to perfect   the graphics are gorgeous  the new options for customization and design are excellent  and nook miles are a fun addition  however  its one fatal flaw is how greatly secondary players are hamstrung  and it is enough of an issue for us that it takes a lot of my enjoyment out of the game and eclipses all the positives i was the one to start thethis game would be so close to perfect   the graphics are gorgeous  the new options for customization and design are excellent  and nook miles are a fun addition  however  its one fatal flaw is how greatly secondary players are hamstrung  and it is enough of an issue for us that it takes a lot of my enjoyment out of the game and eclipses all the positives i was the one to start the game on our switch because i had a day off work  and therefore relegated my partner s save file to being a sidekick that cannot contribute to the main storyline or placement of buildings  and is stuck waiting on whatever progress i amake in the game  even though i have the privilege of being the first player and rr  my enjoyment in the game is nototally shot because i know i took the good spot from my partner we d gladly buy a second copy of the game so we could each have our own island  but we cannot afford to purchase an entire second switch just because nintendo cannot get their act together it is really a shame that such a great game is nototally marred by this  very intentional  design flaw  expand
971,the new animal crossing is really successful and it is great fun to play this game there are many innovations and the gameplay has been made very motivating now comes the big but you can only build one island per console and per game  that means the second player has the a   card  we are currently playing the game in party mode on the couch together and we are just extremelythe new animal crossing is really successful and it is great fun to play this game there are many innovations and the gameplay has been made very motivating now comes the big but you can only build one island per console and per game  that means the second player has the a   card  we are currently playing the game in party mode on the couch together and we are just extremely disappointed with nintendo how can you wouldevelop a game today that has such a bad couch co op mode and then ask a family that everyone should buy a console and a game if you want to build your own island and not all the time like want to run one annoying tag after the other a split iscreen  for example  would have been a great idea for the couch co op  where the second player can go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants  that should be possible without any problems in 2020 i actually would have liked to give the game 5 stars  but i am just disappointed with nintendo  it is not that difficult to provide a separate island for each player on a console unfortunately  all other players lose the fun of the game   expand
972,a game that is nothought for the family and is about sharing  this is where it fails  a game meant to have family and friends playing together  only in fact  allows one island per switch console and caps the other users of the  switch to the development and choices of the first user  simple example  collect all the fruits for your own user and you will be selfish enough not to give youra game that is nothought for the family and is about sharing  this is where it fails  a game meant to have family and friends playing together  only in fact  allows one island per switch console and caps the other users of the  switch to the development and choices of the first user  simple example  collect all the fruits for your own user and you will be selfish enough not to give your younger sister the fruits she so deserved  i am sorry nintendo  i wouldo not feel good about being selfish to my younger sister  that s not how my parents raised me  i cannot agree with this choice from nintendo and it actually concerns me why they would make such a choice for a family game  expand

979,an amazing entry in an amazing series  i love having the ability to craft and customize my own furniture  and this game gives you way more power than you ve ever had to make your town exactly how you want opening the gates to your island and just hanging out with friends while you fish and catch bugs is so much fun  this game came out at the perfect time given current circumstances an amazing entry in an amazing series  i love having the ability to craft and customize my own furniture  and this game gives you way more power than you ve ever had to make your town exactly how you want opening the gates to your island and just hanging out with friends while you fish and catch bugs is so much fun  this game came out at the perfect time given current circumstances i am not time travelling  and i am enjoying the laid back pace of the game  every day gives you a small task to complete and a new visitor to your island  taking things in slowly gives you a good idea of the aspects of the island you like and what you should change later if you are sharing a console  the inability to complete tasks for anyone other than the first user is a serious downside  but if you are playing this on your own switch then it does not affect you  my partner and i are both enjoying the game on our own islands and it is unfortunate some people are not having the same experience a must own switch exclusive  but i am sure you already knew that  expand
980,abysmal second player functionality  the progress in the game is locked by what the first player does 
981,my partner and i purchased   we arealized today that the 2nd user really is just a visitor and cannot progress anything   i really do not understand this logic here   as it istands one player really cannot do anything in the game until the other has time to move things forward there are no separated save slots   it does not matter if you have a unique nintendo login   there is one islandmy partner and i purchased   we arealized today that the 2nd user really is just a visitor and cannot progress anything   i really do not understand this logic here   as it istands one player really cannot do anything in the game until the other has time to move things forward there are no separated save slots   it does not matter if you have a unique nintendo login   there is one island per switch and the first person to login is nothe only person that progresses names the island   it even limits how the 2nd player gets items so completely avoid this notitle unless you are the sole player on your switch   this was a waste of a purchase   as it istands for a family household  it is actually  300  to have a working animal crossing title   well  plus having a separate online account as well  lol  expand
982,everything about the game is awesome  except that you know get one island  if you share a switch only one player get to truly experience gameplay  the other person just runs around with minimal objective and less opportunities  if you are a solo player you will very much enjoy the game  otherwise  do not spend the money 
983,nintendo has done a great job keeping the consistency of the franchise over span of decades   you have games such as mario and zelda where the gameplay matured with new hardwares   you also have games such as pokemon and smash bros where the core gameplay has been kept consistent   i would keep animal crossing under that latter category i have no complain about the gameplay aspect nintendo has done a great job keeping the consistency of the franchise over span of decades   you have games such as mario and zelda where the gameplay matured with new hardwares   you also have games such as pokemon and smash bros where the core gameplay has been kept consistent   i would keep animal crossing under that latter category i have no complain about the gameplay aspect   however  it is a great shame that nintendo is keeping the multiplayer to be limited to one island per switch   if you are going to commit to account based system and let multiplay users to have their own account  you simply can not have this approach of locking different account holders under one environment how awesome would it have been if you as a different user starts your own game and a new island emerges and you get to have your own experience   and you can go visit your family members  island it kinda baffles me why nintendo did not go for this approach with superior hardware such as switch  expand
984,overall a really good game but it isucks that you cannot play the on same island on a secondary console  my primary reason for me to buy the game was to play on the same island as my fiance at the same time instead of this bad couch co op  or atleast be able to play the game split iscreened  i am dissapointed   
985,http chng it cbh8n9py this link sends you to a petition to get more than one island per switch  if we want to make change  we are going to have to do something about it  according  to most people who purchased the game and are not sharing it  they are getting an incredible experience akin to fallout 3  genre notwithstanding  the only reason i amake this statement is due to the fact thathttp chng it cbh8n9py this link sends you to a petition to get more than one island per switch  if we want to make change  we are going to have to do something about it  according  to most people who purchased the game and are not sharing it  they are getting an incredible experience akin to fallout 3  genre notwithstanding  the only reason i amake this statement is due to the fact that if you are player 2 expecting to have as much fun as player 1  the second player on animal crossing  new horizons is basically getting an experience similar to fallout 76  which basically means there are no resources and no reason to progress through the game  the fact that this game does not allow more than one save file per switch tells me that nintendo is notrying to rip people off  and i beware sick of these companies making decisions that try and sway people into spending more money so they can have the same experience as the other person in the house  beware  even during a quarantine  only the first  account has access to do anything remotely fun on this game  if you plan on playing this game after someone else has started an account  just be weary of the fact that you are basically getting a watered down version of the game with no replay value whatsoever  i purchased this game  and now that i started an account after my girlfriend  i basically wasted 60 bucks  and honestly  i am kinda thinking this is a sketchy attempt at getting people to purchase separate nintendo switch consoles just so they can have the same experience as the first person s account  nintendo  please do the right thing and allow separate saves so i can at least enjoy this game  i purchased this game for 60 bucks  but i am getting a crappy experience because you all took away a feature that is literally in 99  of video games  i have never heard of not being able to have at least one extra save file  change your ways or these 0 reviews are going to increase  expand
986,absolute joy  it is just so fun and relaxing  and i hate you people who are bombing the reviews down cause u dont get your two islands per console   you

988,i love new horizons  so much fun and so much to do  i love the graphics as well 
989,the game is okay but the local multiplayer experience is noterrible  one island per console is not so bad  but the fact that subsequent players cannot progress in the game and only the first player  who becomes the island representative  can advance the island is nonsensical  also  many diy recipes are only available to the first player  so if i want a bed in my house i have to getthe game is okay but the local multiplayer experience is noterrible  one island per console is not so bad  but the fact that subsequent players cannot progress in the game and only the first player  who becomes the island representative  can advance the island is nonsensical  also  many diy recipes are only available to the first player  so if i want a bed in my house i have to get resources  give them to my gf  who is nothe first player  and have her make them for me and then get them it is clearly a move made so that nintendo can sell more consoles and greatly anti consumer  hopefully if we get angry enough about this nothey will change that  otherwise they have no reason to  expand
990,while animal crossing is a great game a few things from nintendo really ruins this game  one is nothe fact that you get one island per console  my family has one switch for 3 users meaning that i had to start on a island which was already developed  so to have the full experience i would have to by a new switch  secondly  nintendo seems to be taking down most of the videos made of this gamewhile animal crossing is a great game a few things from nintendo really ruins this game  one is nothe fact that you get one island per console  my family has one switch for 3 users meaning that i had to start on a island which was already developed  so to have the full experience i would have to by a new switch  secondly  nintendo seems to be taking down most of the videos made of this game including pure gameplay  i have clicked on many videos on animal crossing which then said nintendo took it down due to copy right  so overall it is a good game tarnished by another greedy corporation  expand
991,the one island per switch is a real bummer  it is less a feature and more a restriction  especially if you are the second player  it feels like nintendo is notrying to force consumers to buy a second switch  or more 
992,1 island per switch  seriously  i am glad i sold my switch to a friend  wont be buying another 
993,bought because my girlfriend was so excited to play  i worked nightshift the next day so she told me to play first at midnight and report how good it was  i thought it was great until i realized that my girlfriend was player 2 and was greatly upset that she had no progression or objectives in the game  the fact that nintendo would think in any way that this is appropriate  thank god ibought because my girlfriend was so excited to play  i worked nightshift the next day so she told me to play first at midnight and report how good it was  i thought it was great until i realized that my girlfriend was player 2 and was greatly upset that she had no progression or objectives in the game  the fact that nintendo would think in any way that this is appropriate  thank god i wouldo not have kids to fight over who s a mayor  expand
994,i am reviewing this as someone who is not playing as the island representative  not the primary player nintendo s decision to limit the actions of people playing local multiplayer is garbage  they are telling people who love this franchise to buy a second switch or go f  themselves my partner bought the game for us to play together and 6 days in  they have almost 40 furniturei am reviewing this as someone who is not playing as the island representative  not the primary player nintendo s decision to limit the actions of people playing local multiplayer is garbage  they are telling people who love this franchise to buy a second switch or go f  themselves my partner bought the game for us to play together and 6 days in  they have almost 40 furniture recipes and i  who has played the same amount as they have  only have 15  the game severely limits what the second  players can do in the game to the point of making it feel like a bad animal crossing game i would even accept being able to buy all the diy recipes the primary player receives  but at the time of writing this is impossible and player 2 will never be able to build a peach chair it is so strange that nintendo would acknowledge that the switch is a console that is sharable and to be used by more than one person  pokemon swsh allows multiple save accounts per switch so they know several people will play each game on a single console  but turn around and make the game so garbage for everyone but the first to play it i am sure i would love the game if i started playing first  but speaking as someone who did not  fix your s  nintendo  expand
995,the fact that the primary player  the first person to play the game  is nothe only person who has full access to the game is nonsensical  basic features such as obtaining tools are locked to secondary players if the primary player has not unlocked them yet  this makes it hard to play the game as a family  there cannot be cooperation to share an island if members on the island are not equals the fact that the primary player  the first person to play the game  is nothe only person who has full access to the game is nonsensical  basic features such as obtaining tools are locked to secondary players if the primary player has not unlocked them yet  this makes it hard to play the game as a family  there cannot be cooperation to share an island if members on the island are not equals  moreover  there is no indication when you set up the game that primary players will be the only account with full access to the game  this means if you set an account up for your child  parent  partner or any other player who will not play it full time  you can only progress insofar they have unlocked these features for the game for you  very annoying and seems like either nintendo has done this for financial gain or they do not have the ability to have more than one island on each save file  take your pick  expand
996,the one island thing is stupid  zero cloud save is even worse  i fully regret buying this game 
997,great single player  i wouldo not know how they messed up multiplayer so badly  the restrictions are mind boggling  they made it iseem like you could do so much  but you areally do not have any player interaction either 
998,i was really looking forward to this game  so i spent the first day getting my island in order and planned out  i was excited to get to play with my husband and kids then i find that they do not get their own islands  what a waste if we wanna play together we have got to buy more switches and copies of the game  greedy much   nintendo is nothe new coronavirus 
999,could have been the best animal crossing game to date but nope  nintendo has to ruin it by only allowing one island per game  girlfriend loves the game  i absolutely hate it now 
1000,this game is undeniably adorable and super fun  unless  like me  you are the second player on the same switch system  then the game locks you out of all consequential decisions and you have to wait for player one to progress as a passive resident on the same island   the only way to get the full experience is noto but another switch system  this is absolutely not acceptable and has destroyedthis game is undeniably adorable and super fun  unless  like me  you are the second player on the same switch system  then the game locks you out of all consequential decisions and you have to wait for player one to progress as a passive resident on the same island   the only way to get the full experience is noto but another switch system  this is absolutely not acceptable and has destroyed and fun i was having in the game  expand

1003,every single animal crossing entry has been 1 island per console  per memory ignore most of these reviews from players who are salty and clearly havent played animal crossing before 
1004,the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn t cool  in fact  only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from tom nook and other characters  you have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience  that s unacceptable  nintendo is acting alot like ea in this buisness practice 
1005,i am really disappointed by this nintendo game  the fact that you can only play on one island on one console even if you log in through different accounts and only the player nr 1 can actually make progress in the game is very frustrating  i will return the game because nintendo unveils prehistoric strategies to force the people to buy more nintendo switch consoles  for bigger families andi am really disappointed by this nintendo game  the fact that you can only play on one island on one console even if you log in through different accounts and only the player nr 1 can actually make progress in the game is very frustrating  i will return the game because nintendo unveils prehistoric strategies to force the people to buy more nintendo switch consoles  for bigger families and couples it is even more horrible sorry  nintendo very bad move  expand

1014,animal crossing  new horizons is a beautifully crafted game that stays true to it is origins  if you are the first player  i bought this game in hopes that i could share it with my sister  but those hopes have been crushed  i started the game up first  as it is sort of tradition for the older sibling to play the game first in my family  and i had no idea that i was taking away so muchanimal crossing  new horizons is a beautifully crafted game that stays true to it is origins  if you are the first player  i bought this game in hopes that i could share it with my sister  but those hopes have been crushed  i started the game up first  as it is sort of tradition for the older sibling to play the game first in my family  and i had no idea that i was taking away so much freedom from my sister by doing that  when i heard one island per console  i assumed that the island would be the same on different save files  both me and my sister could transform that island into whatever we wanted  but  sadly  the grim reality is nothat she cannot do anything on my island  she can do the basic things  catching bugs and fish  shaking trees  paying off her debt etc  but she s left out of doing anything important  any important progress  like choosing where the buildings and bridges go  is only reserved for me  she s not allowed to have the fun of collecting resources and building our island up from the bottom  and it has ruined both of our experiences  i feel guilty personally knowing my sister  who was greatly looking forward to the game  is extremely disappointed and heartbroken at this development  she cannot have fun  and i cannot play the game without feeling a sense of guilt  nintendo absolutely needs to fix this  the game itself is wonderful  i have been having a great time playing it myself  but i cannot rightfully advocate for this game when it is been such a huge letdown and disappointment for my sister  i wouldo not even mind if they keep the one island per console rhetoric  as long as my sister has the same freedoms i wouldo  if nintendo wants us to play together  then why are they restricting everyone except for the first player  it makes absolutely no sense to keep true to the friendship and bonding aspect to the game if you are literally making that impossible by both restricting any second player onward and making couch co op practically unplayable  expand
1015,only one island per switch  are you guys crazy  already having a hard enough time finding room for new villagers  i have been busily working my island  filling every quadrant with farms  crafting areas with laid out  organized supplies  surplus of fish and shells  furniture arranged in cute little areas  grottos and meadows  decorative flowers as well as areas devoted to crossbreeding  i haveonly one island per switch  are you guys crazy  already having a hard enough time finding room for new villagers  i have been busily working my island  filling every quadrant with farms  crafting areas with laid out  organized supplies  surplus of fish and shells  furniture arranged in cute little areas  grottos and meadows  decorative flowers as well as areas devoted to crossbreeding  i have carefully placed every single tree  and then my brother wants to play  i would love for him to  well  cannot bc i have set my whole island  also crappy that another player can come in and just put their house wherever  with the option of deleting whatever is in that area  also a dumb choice with the nook mile quests  chip down a tree  plant a tree  plant flowers  etc  i want my island to be my own  at least in previous games you had the choice of swapping memory cards or cartridges  huge disappointment and just looks money grubby on nintendo part  want your own island  buy another switch  yeah right enjoy the negative reviews from angry consumers  nintendo  expand
1016,good game if it on your own personal switch but if you share it with anyone that also wants to play the game it is not  you have to share the same island but that s nothing new the big thing is nothat if you wanted to progress through the game to unlock stuff you have to be the first person to start the game otherwise you are not going to be able to  if you have a switch and more than one kidgood game if it on your own personal switch but if you share it with anyone that also wants to play the game it is not  you have to share the same island but that s nothing new the big thing is nothat if you wanted to progress through the game to unlock stuff you have to be the first person to start the game otherwise you are not going to be able to  if you have a switch and more than one kid who plays it do not get them this game because it will bring nothing but trouble with it  expand
1017,i spent days ignoring negative feedback and wondering why i couldnt make progress in the game  turns out anyone aside from the first person to arrive at the island cannot do jack  all i can do is collect sticks and bugs  this is a massively disappointing experience  no game here 
1018,it is painfully slow and boring  it is not fun at all and personally does not win me over with their  cute character designs  maybe i am not the right deomgraphic
1019,only one island per console  way to capitalize nintendo definately not worth it 
1020,2 filles jumelles   l une est en pleurs  inconsolable  elle m a dit plus jamais nintendo   une fan pourtant inconditionnelle  n achetez surtout pas ce jeu si vous avez 2 enfants ou plus 
1021,i really love the game  but being the second player suck so bad  you cant participate in the story and miss a ton of diy recipe  it just kill my experience 
1022,this game was an utter let down  i have been playing games all my life but never had the chance to play any games in the animal crossing series  my girlfriend was overtly excited about this new game and i figured i would purchase this for her and i could enjoy something refreshing and new  she plays all day when i bought it and i tried to start my own island the following day  one island perthis game was an utter let down  i have been playing games all my life but never had the chance to play any games in the animal crossing series  my girlfriend was overtly excited about this new game and i figured i would purchase this for her and i could enjoy something refreshing and new  she plays all day when i bought it and i tried to start my own island the following day  one island per switch is crap and i am not even going to try and play this game  you lost a potential player  i amade an account on metacritic strictly to relay my disgust  expand
1023,i literally spent the first two days trying to figure out why i was not able to progress in the game only to find out that s because my wife started the game first  so i basically cannot access 100  of the game right now  that s a very lame way to make people buy a brand new console just for one game  the switch is supposed to be a familial console and this came is not 
1024,overall is a fun game but nintendo needs to change their user treatment  now if you or your girlfriend or brother want to play the game you paid full price  you need to buy a new nintendo switch  not just a new game but a new game and a new nintendo switch  that makes no sense and seems like they are making fun of us as users 
1025,this game deserves 9 10 but gets 0 at this notime i cannot be that only one island is possible for each switch and not for each account on the switch  especially living in a shared flat with friends   s
1026,pas la possibilité de créer plusieurs îles et injouable pour le deuxième joueur de la console
1027,bought this with the intention to have 3 people play on my switch  just to find out we cannot start out own campaigns or do things the first player does   the feature to save your own campaign on a console has been around for 20 years  and is solely a money grabbing technique to make us buy another switch   hugely disappointed as i thought nintendo was above this kind of scheme 
1028,this is a fantastic game if you are the first one on it  if you unlucky enough to be the second one  and cannot shell out the money to buy a whole new switch and game  then your stuck being just a visitor with a house  you have no control over what happens on the island apart from being able to decorate your house and pick up weeds  being one island per console is bad but essentially onethis is a fantastic game if you are the first one on it  if you unlucky enough to be the second one  and cannot shell out the money to buy a whole new switch and game  then your stuck being just a visitor with a house  you have no control over what happens on the island apart from being able to decorate your house and pick up weeds  being one island per console is bad but essentially one player per console is noterrible  i have been a fan of animal crossing for so long and loved everyone of them but if they had told us of these limitations before release i would not have bought it  expand
1029,i am confused as to why there is such an outrage over the fact that there is only one island per switch  there has always only ever been one town per cartridge  this complaint is extremely nonsensical and review bombing the game isn t going to help 
1030,one island per switch its so sad to play  it ishould ve been limited to 3 islands per console at least or something like that so most members of a family can enjoy the game properly  not everybody can buy more than one switch 
1031,multiplayer sucks  it is so bad to not be able to play with another player on one switch  this makes me so mad and sad at the same time
1032,it is abused    a single island per console means practically only one user while there were 4 of us including my 3 kids wanting to play it on our different profiles  i am disgusted by this game and nintendo 
1033,cant even have my own island as another member of my household has already started playing  ridiculous  we do not have the money to buy a new nintendo switch  fix your game 
1034,animal crossing  new horizons only allows one save file per switch  anyone who shares a switch will not be able to play the game  very disappointing  text and cutscenes also need to be skippable 
1035,only one island per switch  even if you have another copy of the game  the saved file remains on the switch  i can appreciate developers incorporating new ideas to get people to play together  but such things shouldnt be forced upon the player 
1036,absolutely love this addition to the animal crossing series  cannot put my controller down for long without wanting to hop back on 
1037,absolutely love this game  have been addicted as soon as it was available to play in my region  i wouldo not have any issues with the complaints about multiplayer limitations  my partner and i have been having a wonderful time collaborating and building our island together  it is been a really nice bonding moment actually  i especially love how they made changing the leader character so seamlessabsolutely love this game  have been addicted as soon as it was available to play in my region  i wouldo not have any issues with the complaints about multiplayer limitations  my partner and i have been having a wonderful time collaborating and building our island together  it is been a really nice bonding moment actually  i especially love how they made changing the leader character so seamless by just shaking the joycon controller  expand
1038,great game overall  but the lack of multiple islands is a bit disappointing  i am not affected by this  but i can see why others are 
1039,amazing game to have right now  i am only three days in but i can see this as a game i will be playing off and on for at least a year 
1040,they absolutely blew my expectations out of this world  i could have not asked for a more perfect game  there are plenty of things to look forward too as well and am highly anticipating the many years i am going to put into this beauty 
1041,folks seem to think that a mild inconvenience is worth giving a game a rating of 0  if the game does not run  or damages your hardware  or if it is literally unplayable  then that deserves a 0  it is a gorgeous game that makes me happy  it is probably one of the strongest titles in the series  folks giving this game a 0 are one of the reasons we cannot have nice things
1042,great animal crossing game  unless you wouldo not wanna play with someone else and multiple accounts  you are going to have some serious fun for a lot of time

1044,what an amazing  game super fun to play i grew up with nintendo but i have never played animal crossing and wow i have been missing out  it is fun to play theres tons of things to do and kill time especially with the corona virus going on right now  but i have to give this game a 5 and that reason being is nothat well to start off i got this game for my wife she loves animal crossing  we werewhat an amazing  game super fun to play i grew up with nintendo but i have never played animal crossing and wow i have been missing out  it is fun to play theres tons of things to do and kill time especially with the corona virus going on right now  but i have to give this game a 5 and that reason being is nothat well to start off i got this game for my wife she loves animal crossing  we were excited to play until we found out we could not have two islands you would need to purchase a separate switch to have two island s what a bummer   and you are limited on the second player i hope they listen to the gamer base and change this because we are not happy  please fix this  i would give this a ten but the lack of another island baffles me  expand
1045,calming but fun  very enjoyable for someone who plays many different types of games and was looking for something easy going to play for about an hour each day  i wouldid have to get used to playing in real time  but its all good now
1046,game does not let you keep multiple islands  it is only one island per switch  if you have two people sharing a console do not plan on both of them playing this  cannot even buy two copies  nope  one island per switch  horrible way to do it
1047,as always this is a chill game  lol to those negative comments  this must be your first ac game  next time do not get hype without researching the game 
1048,local multiplayer is completely broken  one island per console and the first player is nothe only one that can actually progress the game  and gets free things that the others have to pay for  woe betide the household that lets their young child play first  as they will not be inclined to work to keep the game moving for everybody else and you will all be stuck in the doldrums forever 
1049,bought this game mostly because my girlfriend wanted it and because it claims to have local co op  it iseemed like a perfect game for us to share and play together  i ended up getting really into it until i realized how big of a problem sharing one island is and not being able to have separate save files  this major flaw essentially makes this purchase a complete waste of money  if you arebought this game mostly because my girlfriend wanted it and because it claims to have local co op  it iseemed like a perfect game for us to share and play together  i ended up getting really into it until i realized how big of a problem sharing one island is and not being able to have separate save files  this major flaw essentially makes this purchase a complete waste of money  if you are going to play by yourself  it is worth it but if you are planning to share this game with anyone in your house dont even bother  it is a complete waste of money and a terribly flawed game unless of course you plan on buying another switch to share the game with someone  expand
1050,fun game  it is shameful that they have bricked up the ac experience just because they would not want you sharing too much of the game  no no  make your family buy individual switches so they can have any fun at all  i hope they fix this or it comes back to bite them  they do not deserve the support they have received 
1051,the game is great  i was an avid player of new leaf  and this game is an improvement in most ways the graphics are amazing  i actually love taking pictures in my little town because of how pretty the water is and how nicely my character is rendered  catching critters and chopping trees feels the same as new leaf  which is noto say  good  i really appreciate the ability to choose wherethe game is great  i was an avid player of new leaf  and this game is an improvement in most ways the graphics are amazing  i actually love taking pictures in my little town because of how pretty the water is and how nicely my character is rendered  catching critters and chopping trees feels the same as new leaf  which is noto say  good  i really appreciate the ability to choose where the other villagers live and being able to place furniture outside  overall it is a very strong addition to the series that being said  i hate that the tools can break now  it is pretty annoying when you are in the middle of a long spree of fishing or catching bugs and your tool breaks in the middle of it  i hate tool durability in general  but in a game that s supposed to just be about chilling out and having fun  this feels more like a chore  the crafting system as a whole is sort of meh to me  and i am sure i will not like it more as my playthrough goes on overall i am giving this game a ten purely because animal crossing is always going to be one of my favorite comfort games  and new horizons is an amazing update to the franchise  expand
1052,another peaceful and relaxing game from animal crossing  i love the cute characters that you can have move in to your island and all the customisation options  i also love how it is done in real time  it keeps you coming back for more 
1053,already my 2020 goty  played it for about 35 hours now and i love it 
1054,this new ac game is far beyond anything i or anyone could have hoped for  it is still ac and for those who played new leaf you will find many similar aspects suck as the first person being the community rep like being the mayor in new leaf for those who read the negative views about one island per switch seem forget that you only got one town per save  3ds  or gamecart like thethis new ac game is far beyond anything i or anyone could have hoped for  it is still ac and for those who played new leaf you will find many similar aspects suck as the first person being the community rep like being the mayor in new leaf for those who read the negative views about one island per switch seem forget that you only got one town per save  3ds  or gamecart like the previous games  if you had a digital download of new leaf you only got one town per 3ds  you get one island per switch because that s where the save data is saved to  like a ps4 or xbox you wouldo not save data to the disk you save to the system the local play could be reworked to be better but if you are done being a helper you can change leaders allowing the new leader to do everything they could not before  and with anything new in a series it will still need more work before it is perfected the only complaint i really have would be tool durability but a tool breaking is a minor inconvenience as being stung by wasps when you shake a tree and there is plenty stuff around to make new tools its not even a problem i honestly find my self just opening the game and listening to it iso i can sleep  there is far more goals and things you can do now  and one of the best features we have always needed is nothe bug and fish critterpedia tells you if something has been donated so you wouldo not need to  scour your museum to see what your missing from what you caught  this game is beyond peaceful and is nothe next step towards wasting months of my time like new leaf and those before it  expand
1055,enjoying this game so much so far  really feels like a great  undated version of the original ds game  i wouldo not really understand why everyone is complaining about the multiplayer  it is been fine for me so far 
1056,when you need a break from life and you want to chill with some animal friends  gather fruits  explore  build and feel like you have a great vacation on your own island   just play animal crossing 
1057,excellent  visually adorable  music is fantastic  so many things to do plus cute characters  child friendly with really cool gameplay  love it 
1058,as a long time animal crossing fan  this game is a dream  it was more than worth the wait  heck  i would ve waited even longer 
1059,this is nothe best animal crossing game  so addicting  there is so many things to do 
1060,it is an amazing daily time waster i enjoy  it could be improved sure   maybe next iteration  but as of now the formulae works and i am fine with this version   also if they were to make it open world or have an infinite amount of towns  your town would not mean anything or be special   it would not be animal crossing 
1061,i have been playing the game nonstop everyday  i love it  this game came out at the perfect time seeing as how everyone is locked in their homes
1062,definitely the best animal crossing game  my fave switch game too probably  the games have always been made for sharing and it was common knowledge before release that it was one island per console  people be butthurt
1063,i think everyone on here bashing it and giving it is a 0 because nintendo locked it to one island per console is an a s s h o l e  so i am rating it 10 10 to offset all of the negative reviews  enjoy buying 2 switches 
1064,amazingly fun  never gets old  never run out of things to do  graphics are extremely well done  the creativity and options are awesome  absolutely fantastic game 
1065,it is a really good game  i loved this game  i want to play more  this is a game that you can do what you like  the villagers has personality and you can like that one and not like this one  is a simple game  but very especial
1066,amazing  frankly  one of the best games i have ever played  emphasis on i  this series isn t for everyone  which you can clearly tell by the 0 reviews from action junkies  but once you get into it  it is one of the most fun experiences out there  just set your expectations right  and have fun 
1067,a beautiful game  this game is full of relaxing music and actions  it hits home where other games in the series shine  it add new and interesting game play that makes your island yours  now you will e seeing reviews annoyed bout the how you can only have 1 island per console  this personally does not bother me and i play with 4 other people  it is fun to play bulld our island together  plusa beautiful game  this game is full of relaxing music and actions  it hits home where other games in the series shine  it add new and interesting game play that makes your island yours  now you will e seeing reviews annoyed bout the how you can only have 1 island per console  this personally does not bother me and i play with 4 other people  it is fun to play bulld our island together  plus it is true to past animal crossing games  expand
1068,amazing game  it is a shame that people are giving such a harsh review for one aspect of the game  an aspect that does not affect game play at all  to say it is a great game  but then giving it a 1 or a 0 out of 10  is childish  animal crossing new horizons is everything i have expected it to be and more  it is an easy 10 out of 10 for me and i hope that people still but it and do not letamazing game  it is a shame that people are giving such a harsh review for one aspect of the game  an aspect that does not affect game play at all  to say it is a great game  but then giving it a 1 or a 0 out of 10  is childish  animal crossing new horizons is everything i have expected it to be and more  it is an easy 10 out of 10 for me and i hope that people still but it and do not let these ridiculous reviews sway them in any way  expand
1069,yeah i got addicted to this it is really great  it could have a better multiplayer  but that s about it 
1070,i wouldecided to tune in and let everyone reading know that animal crossing new horizons is a wonderful game in the animal crossing series  the sales and positive reviews speak for itself  but there is a lot that could be improved  i would of liked to see more streamlined menus  sometimes when selling and navigating menus it can be a bit islow  an option to speed things up would of been nice i wouldecided to tune in and let everyone reading know that animal crossing new horizons is a wonderful game in the animal crossing series  the sales and positive reviews speak for itself  but there is a lot that could be improved  i would of liked to see more streamlined menus  sometimes when selling and navigating menus it can be a bit islow  an option to speed things up would of been nice  and with the multiplayer  i think the way we invite other players to our town could of been more streamlined and have less loading screens one big complaint people have is with the way nintendo decided to handle multiple users playing  you can only have 1 island  and the first person to launch the game is basically the one in charge  the 2nd player has a slightly limited experience  for instance  you have  to wait for the 1st player to trigger certain events such as building tom nooks store  or deciding on where to place a bridge  and until they do that  your island will be kind of locked in a state where you wouldo not have access to those things until player 1 unlocks them  on one hand it is a bad decision  given how there are better ways this could of been managed  but on the other hand this is nintendo  and their vision  and this is how all animal crossing games have been more or less  however i think they should of went the extra step with multiple residents living together and i hope that they can improve things even more in the coming patches or next release while this game is amazing and has things that can be improved  i think a lot of the review bombing is from people that have a serious case of you wouldid not make the game i wanted you to make and now i am upset  life goes on people  you wouldo not like something  speak up  but review bombing a game in this manner is just silly 9 10  expand
1071,this is a wonderful game that does not deserve these petty 0 review scores  you have a problem  contact nintendo  this game gives me something to look forward to every day while i am stuck in quarantine  much like the rest of the world  i love playing multiplayer with my online friends and collecting all the fossils  bugs  and fish for the absolutely gorgeous museum  the new interior designthis is a wonderful game that does not deserve these petty 0 review scores  you have a problem  contact nintendo  this game gives me something to look forward to every day while i am stuck in quarantine  much like the rest of the world  i love playing multiplayer with my online friends and collecting all the fossils  bugs  and fish for the absolutely gorgeous museum  the new interior design mechanics are a lifesaver and i love this game so much  please give it a try  and do not listen to those petty 0 reviews akin to a whiny five year old child not getting what they want  expand
1072,the game is a wonderful  peaceful  and adorable masterpiece that is probably the best of all previous animal crossing games  although i was initially distressed at the shared island for multiple users  now that i am used to it it is actually a fun little feature  overall amazing and relaxing  definitely worth it 
1073,the game is fantastic  just as it always has been  giving us a clean slate with absolutely nothing on the island gives us a new challenge like we have never had before  to those people who are review bombing the game  take your extremely weak minded comments some where else  you are ruining a good game with your nonsense  you all should be ashamed of yourselves  throwing a zero at a gamethe game is fantastic  just as it always has been  giving us a clean slate with absolutely nothing on the island gives us a new challenge like we have never had before  to those people who are review bombing the game  take your extremely weak minded comments some where else  you are ruining a good game with your nonsense  you all should be ashamed of yourselves  throwing a zero at a game because of one single thing  shame on you  expand
1074,i am very sad to see  people reviewing just a multiplayer bug and not the game  the game is so much fun  the world is open and colorful  the quests are perfect for the series and keep you looking for goals to complete  i have visited my son s island online and hes visited mine  that seems to work perfectly  i love the characters and the interactions in the game  again  like i said in thei am very sad to see  people reviewing just a multiplayer bug and not the game  the game is so much fun  the world is open and colorful  the quests are perfect for the series and keep you looking for goals to complete  i have visited my son s island online and hes visited mine  that seems to work perfectly  i love the characters and the interactions in the game  again  like i said in the beginning   do not let a bunch of review bombers keep you from enjoying this game  expand
1075,it is really cute and fun  it makes me smile and if you want some fun to pass the time pick it uppeople are review bombing it because they do not like one island per switch but that does not affect me and is a perfect game for me if your lonely and want some friends pick up this game
1076,animal crossing has been a series beloved by many  and for good reason  it is a feel good  calm and open ended game that allows the user to live a second day to day life among the animals of the world  animal crossing  new horizons stays true to that formula   in some cases   while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series new horizons drops the player into aanimal crossing has been a series beloved by many  and for good reason  it is a feel good  calm and open ended game that allows the user to live a second day to day life among the animals of the world  animal crossing  new horizons stays true to that formula   in some cases   while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series new horizons drops the player into a deserted island setting with two other random villagers  you are here by order of tom nook and his apprentices timmy   tommy  who have set a vacation package for you  you start off the game in a cycle of material grinding and crafting  almost as if you just started a new minecraft world  the newest functionality in the series to date here is nothe crafting and use of raw materials  you will build tools  a lot  harvest raw materials from rocks and trees  and continue crafting each day to make new furniture  fulfill any requests tom nook lays out for you  and to even build some homes while there are no true end goals or end game  animal crossing has never been about that  the game does give a player a general direction  in which you and nook will build the island into a bustling little community  where you have complete control on housing location  bridges  inclines  and even the terrain  the creativity mixed with the endless amount of items there iseems to be leaves for many to dump hours daily into a series you would typically only play for an hour or so every so often  this in addition to the nook miles  a set of finite and smaller infinite goals  allows for an addictive and repetitive game play experience  house decorating has received a major overhaul with the new drag and drop editor  a godsend  the developer definitely focused a lot on small details too  with the gorgeous graphics depicting realistic rain  wind rustling the trees and weeds  detailed bugs and fish  and even the ability to eat fruit for a reason while new horizons expands in many ways  there are some choices that have left the game feeling a little bit lonely  and others confused  things such as gyroids and the cafe  or other staples of the series are completely missing  the happy home academy no longer has a cool online showcase of player homes  and has gone back to simply sending you random gifts each week  a lot of the nintendo themed game items seemed to have disappeared  and the ones available have become extremely harder to obtain and there are few of them  one of the saddest changes to me so far seems to be with your villagers  there are so many to possibly have move in  but unlike older games where villager interaction was a major part of what you wouldo  it feels very stripped down in new horizons  villagers  more often than not  repeat the same dialogues each day  and usually do not have much to say in general  it is rare to get one caught on a tangent  or ask you random questions  or request your help finding an item  in new leaf you could even play games like hide and seek with them  but in new horizons it iseems they d rather stay home or stretch in the town plaza and say a couple blips to you and that s it lastly  multiplayer and the handling of saves naturally come into the discussion  a lot of people have shared concern over the fact one system has one island  and while it might be shocking to new players  this isn t the only animal crossing to function this way  one system usually holds one world for multiple players to play on  while they have locked progression to the first user  a bad call in many ways  the overall state of it is notypical here but i can see why it would obstruct the fun for many families or couples who only have one switch  general multiplayer  especially online and local wireless  is basic and for that its fun  you can set best friends  and you can all visit each other s islands to talk to locals  hang out  and acquire materials  no qualms there lastly  we have to look at the save backups  there currently exist no way to do so  but they have stated they re working on a system to cater to those that need it new horizons is an amazingly fun and addictive title with beautiful graphics  cheery and calming music  and endless creative possibilities  while it is a great ac game  many series fans will be bummed about the loss of many series mainstays and might find it lacking for that matter  but it has become widely accessible for that reason  and i can safely say it is a wonderful game and i cannot recommend it enough for its gameplay and aesthetic alone  expand
1077,this game is just awesome  everything about the game is so polished  cute and well made  i just know this is a game i will be spending the majority of my quarantine time on as well as many more hours after  my favorite game on switch and the best game in the animal crossing series so far 
1078,finally an animal crossing where we can put our leave down outside of our house and it can actually be the object  even though animal crossing in the past was played for years in our house including my elderly mother who played happily played  a new leaf  from the day it came out until now   our hopes finally came true with new horizons  i like that when we go into our house we cannoturnfinally an animal crossing where we can put our leave down outside of our house and it can actually be the object  even though animal crossing in the past was played for years in our house including my elderly mother who played happily played  a new leaf  from the day it came out until now   our hopes finally came true with new horizons  i like that when we go into our house we cannoturn the toggle switch so we have a 360  view of each room  i wish we could do that on the outside of the house as well    expand

1080,not the greatest game on the switch  but definitely a great game nonetheless this game retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements  such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside many people are having issue that multiple users on the same switch can only play onnot the greatest game on the switch  but definitely a great game nonetheless this game retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements  such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside many people are having issue that multiple users on the same switch can only play on the same island  however this has been a staple of the series since the beginning  do not believe the review bombers  this game is worth your money  being able to play on the same island can be a fun experience  you and your other islanders can work together to make a little piece of paradise  it is notrue that only the first character made can go though the starting tutorial  but this is honestly a great choice as it can be slow and put many people new to the series off  expand
1081,great game  so much fun and so much to do  they really stream lined a lot of stuff to make it quicker and easier which i really appreciate 
1082,i have been a massive fan of the animal crossing franchise for a while  love the whole updated feel the game gets on the switch  so many little details left out of earlier games look soo much better on this console  having fun with friends trying to get all the different fruits so i can grow my little fruit empire  and a great way to pass the time while stuck indoors the crafting cani have been a massive fan of the animal crossing franchise for a while  love the whole updated feel the game gets on the switch  so many little details left out of earlier games look soo much better on this console  having fun with friends trying to get all the different fruits so i can grow my little fruit empire  and a great way to pass the time while stuck indoors the crafting can be a little grinding at times  but when you have nothing else planned for the day  then i shall chop wood and hit istones to my heart s content  expand
1083,this game tweaks so many tiny irritable game parts of the series past that adds to a game you can play all day

1092,this is everything i have ever wanted in an animal crossing game  my only complaint is nothe durability on tools  everything else is wonderful so far  i hope those leaving negative reviews actually get the chance to play this amazing game 
1093,una obre de arte que salió justo en tiempos de cuarentena  el juego tiene progresión calmada  buen soundtrack y personalización de personajes
1094,es uno de los mejores juegos para relajarse y jugar un rato día a día  es muy entretenido y si te enganchas no vas a poder parar de jugarlo  sin duda alguna el mejor animal crossing que ha salido y un muy buen juego por si solo 
1095,please stop the review bombing this game is beautiful and relaxing animal crossing has never supported more than 1  town nothing is changed by this game not supporting it 
1096,game is real good  wonderful evolution for the series  ignore any 0 s you see on here  just head the warnings if you are looking for local play on one console  does not take away from the games wonderful atmosphere

1098,absolutely wonderful game with fun stuff to do   great for relaxing   customizing and learning new things  take it a day at a time with this one 
1099,this is an amazing game  people have to many personal expectations  if you want to live on a deserted island this is nothe game for you  its suppose to be about you alone building a relation with the island dwellers  its fun and amazing  do not listen to haters  life s a game  play it 
1100,one of the best games nintendo has published in years  very addicting game play and charming characters  i know this will be a beloved game for years to come and not hard to say it is an instant classic
1101,as a animal crossing veteran since gamecube days  i have to say this is nothe best animal crossing game made  it has charm  character and longevity  all put into one cute world  i would highly recommend you playing this game and not listening to the negative comments 
1102,new horizons is nothe first animal crossing game that has managed to keep me engaged for more than a few days  and i can see myself playing this one daily far into the future   the mix between old and new parts of the  formula  have finally created something that i wouldeeply enjoy playing   it is especially nice to have a little something pleasant to fall back on every day with the worldnew horizons is nothe first animal crossing game that has managed to keep me engaged for more than a few days  and i can see myself playing this one daily far into the future   the mix between old and new parts of the  formula  have finally created something that i wouldeeply enjoy playing   it is especially nice to have a little something pleasant to fall back on every day with the world currently going a little nuts over this whole virus situation i am sorry to hear that the way of handling multiple family members on the same console is so bad   seriously  it isounds terrible  and i think this aspect of the game could have been done a lot better   i wouldocked one point off my score for you guys  but only one point  because it does not affect my experience   if you are planning on being the sole owner and player of this game like i am  it is absolutely wonderful  expand
1103,i bought it iso my girlfriend and i could play  well as in sure you are all aware  that s not how it worked out  i inabilty to have more than one island per console really upset us  at this point it is her game and i ll stick to my ps4 
1104,even though the game starts off slow  once you get into things and upgrade your tent the game is notruly magical  super relaxing to complete tasks  gain nook miles and explore your island 
1105,unplayable for more than one child set up in such a way that it is pretty much unplayable outside of singleplayer  you have to buy a whole other switch and game if you want peace and quiet out of kids playing  dirty practise from a company renowned for making family games outside of the cash gouging  very little of the game mechanics is explained  especially if you are the second personunplayable for more than one child set up in such a way that it is pretty much unplayable outside of singleplayer  you have to buy a whole other switch and game if you want peace and quiet out of kids playing  dirty practise from a company renowned for making family games outside of the cash gouging  very little of the game mechanics is explained  especially if you are the second person to jump in and try to play items are trapped behinds arbitrary walls put in place by tom nook  in single player  that s frustrating  the resources needed for multiple people to achieve this kinda makes it isomewhat miserable to play sure  it is cute  sure the music is nice  but you can get all of that from the old gamesi think the scores of ten are coming from people treating this as a sacred cow  expand
1106,created an account just to add my voice to the crowd  i bought the game for my fiancé and i to play together  of the two of us  i am the one who is much more likely to play  i let her play the game first so that she could name the island and choose where ishe wanted her house  little did i know that she would become the primary player  essentially locking me out of progressing the island oncreated an account just to add my voice to the crowd  i bought the game for my fiancé and i to play together  of the two of us  i am the one who is much more likely to play  i let her play the game first so that she could name the island and choose where ishe wanted her house  little did i know that she would become the primary player  essentially locking me out of progressing the island on my own at all  what is nothe point in separating what each player has the capability of doing  she mostly enjoys fishing and catching butterflies  and isn t interested at all in grinding material  none the less  it is up to her to progress the game  building items for new homes  opening the museum  etc  on top of that  she s given recipes that i wouldo not get to make these things for the home  the secondary account is just at pure disadvantage  i knew coming into the game that we had to share an island  which i had no issue with  what i wouldid not realize was that i had to deal with a caste system and have my villager live like a second hand citizen  there was no warning that the secondary account was going to have limited influence on the island  there is no way to switch who is in what position  either  nintendo really needs to fix this issue  i would be having a thoroughly enjoyable time if it was not for this awful system  expand
1107,i bought a nintendo switch specifically for this game and was sooo excited to get into it  but it turns out you can only have one save file and on top of that  only one character has full freedom in the progress of the island  and since me and sister split the money it took to buy the switch and the game  we were planning to both play  but  little did we know  we cannot both playi bought a nintendo switch specifically for this game and was sooo excited to get into it  but it turns out you can only have one save file and on top of that  only one character has full freedom in the progress of the island  and since me and sister split the money it took to buy the switch and the game  we were planning to both play  but  little did we know  we cannot both play individually  what a waste of money for restricted gameplay  expand
1108,do not know why the user score is so low  you are crazy  this is perfect  this was my most anticipated game for the switch and i am completely overwhelmed
1109,set up a metacritic account just to score this game 10 10  its ridiculous that fans are review bombing it purely because of one thing they dislike  this game is incredible  whether you are an old time animal crossing fan like myself or are new to the series  works perfectly for the switch and i have really appreciated it even more so during this global crisis  spending time developing yourset up a metacritic account just to score this game 10 10  its ridiculous that fans are review bombing it purely because of one thing they dislike  this game is incredible  whether you are an old time animal crossing fan like myself or are new to the series  works perfectly for the switch and i have really appreciated it even more so during this global crisis  spending time developing your own personal island with friendly animal residents cheering you along the way  trust me  you wouldont want to miss out on this game  nintendo have promised regular updates with special events relating to current seasons etc  non stop content for all  expand
1110,the developers worked very hard on all the details in this version of the game  haters are complaining about a pre existing mechanic in all other versions  and it is an animal crossing premise  i just loved this game and i have no complaints  even the high price i feel is a fair value for the product 
1111,anyone rate bombing this game for one bad feature needs to stop you wouldumb and you should feel bad
1112,the game is nice  if you are the first player and therefore the  owner  of the island  if you are second player  you are tied to the progress of the first  which is really annoying and takes away from the game  basically only the first player has some kind of story  all others just do not  therefore it is just plain boring sharing the island in itself is no problem for me at all  but notthe game is nice  if you are the first player and therefore the  owner  of the island  if you are second player  you are tied to the progress of the first  which is really annoying and takes away from the game  basically only the first player has some kind of story  all others just do not  therefore it is just plain boring sharing the island in itself is no problem for me at all  but not being able to do all things i want to do  without switching character  is otherwise it is quite relaxing  as animal crossing always was  the tools breaking can be annoying at times  too  but you learn to work around it  the graphics are super cute  and being able to create the clothing i want is great  too  expand

1115,the game is really great  enjoy it isince release day  but one island is just unacceptable 
1116,  this greedy  piece of   corporate bull  company  the one island per switch is nothe most blatantly greedy move ever  their argument was to have multiple players work together to build the island  which sounds great on paper  but the second player literally cannot do jack   to contribute to the island  so not only did they not allow multiple islands  they also did not follow up  this greedy  piece of   corporate bull  company  the one island per switch is nothe most blatantly greedy move ever  their argument was to have multiple players work together to build the island  which sounds great on paper  but the second player literally cannot do jack   to contribute to the island  so not only did they not allow multiple islands  they also did not follow up on a viable alternative   what a bunch of scumbags they are using ea as a role model and only thinking about profits rather than user experience  i will not be purchasing a single switch game anymore from now on  good thing ps5 is coming out soon  expand
1117,being restricted to one island per system is absolutely infuriating for a game like this  the island is notoo small resources scarce to add other players and progress is notied to the first person who made the account  now only one member of my household can play the game and  ever and it is really terrible  i understand that this was a feature of the older games  but it is one of the worstbeing restricted to one island per system is absolutely infuriating for a game like this  the island is notoo small resources scarce to add other players and progress is notied to the first person who made the account  now only one member of my household can play the game and  ever and it is really terrible  i understand that this was a feature of the older games  but it is one of the worst features i have ever experienced with any game for this particular one  expand
1118,i am sure this is a great game if you live on your own or have a switch all to yourself  if you wouldo not  well  bad news   this is basically a one player per console kinda deal  if you have kids or share a console with a loved one   do not waste your money on this 
1119,improves on the premise of the old games well while adding all new mechanics  having tons of fun so far  and leaving this review mostly to combat the idiots review bombing over the small flaws this game has 
1120,absolutely ridiculous that two players cannot have their own individual islands on a current gen system  there is absolutely zero reason that such a limitation should exist beyond greed  nintendo support actually told me to buy a second system  are you kidding me  buy a second video game console if i want to be able to fully experience a game just like my fiance on our switch  is nintendoabsolutely ridiculous that two players cannot have their own individual islands on a current gen system  there is absolutely zero reason that such a limitation should exist beyond greed  nintendo support actually told me to buy a second system  are you kidding me  buy a second video game console if i want to be able to fully experience a game just like my fiance on our switch  is nintendo out of their minds so be prepared  my fiance is nothe island representative or whatever because she played first  she gets to progress the game  she gets to name the island  she gets to build stuff  i just get to follow and wander around like an advanced npc  oh  and island resources spawn ridiculously slowly  so if she plays before me on what s her island that i am pretty much a guest on  i am just sol unless she leaves some for me  i wouldo not even feel like there is a point in me playing thisi am sure she would say it is a 10 10 experience  but it is a 0 10 for me because i get some halfbaked version for my money and cannot experience the full version with my own profile on the console and my own save files i was so excited for this  i bought my switch for this a few months ago  what an embarrassment for nintendo to pull this  expand
1121,ended up returning the game purely based off the fact that it locks all other users on the switch out of progressing the game  we will repurchase it when this is changed but it is complete brainless game design  also siting other games in the series as being the same is flawed because the original ac game on gamecube you could have separate towns per memory card 
1122,if more than one person wants to play this game on the same switch you are out of luck  the game limits you to one island per switch and if you are not the first person to join then you are a side character who cant make any decisions or progress the game in any way 
1123,my boyfriend bought this game for us to play together but since there is only one island per console we ended up competing for resources accomplishments until he gave up because he wanted me to have fun playing it rather than him 
1124,seriously  my wife started the game and i came on as second player  i cannot do squat to push the game forward and must wait for her to play to do anything  absolute failure on nintendo s part  complete bs i cannot get my money back

1126,my whole family was very excited for this game  we were willing to accept the whole one island game even though it isucks  my problem is nothat only the creator of the island gets the whole game  since my husband made the island he s getting all these cool quests  build and furnish 3 houses  place a bridge  a store etc  everyone else can just collect things  that s it  collect and build amy whole family was very excited for this game  we were willing to accept the whole one island game even though it isucks  my problem is nothat only the creator of the island gets the whole game  since my husband made the island he s getting all these cool quests  build and furnish 3 houses  place a bridge  a store etc  everyone else can just collect things  that s it  collect and build a house  i am an adult  not a 3 year old  so a game with no goals is bumming me out  at this point i would rather have an island of my own  expand
1127,second player limitations is ridiculous  shared island should have shared responsibilities  second player has no motivation in the game because you are hindered based on player 1s progress  you cant contribute to projects  receive extra nook miles for completing task  or receive cool diys because only player 1 receives them 
1128,i would agree with most reviews that having a very   messed up multiplayer system is bad and will move people away  however i would say if you love old animal crossing then your in luck and all that old goodness is here  however if your wanting something more substantial or have a narrative to keep you entertained intrigued why you are locked at home i am sorry you are not going to find it i would agree with most reviews that having a very   messed up multiplayer system is bad and will move people away  however i would say if you love old animal crossing then your in luck and all that old goodness is here  however if your wanting something more substantial or have a narrative to keep you entertained intrigued why you are locked at home i am sorry you are not going to find it  this game is more meant for doing very small monotonous things think of it almost like stardew valley and if you are not really into games like that then it does not get much better and it is slowly starting to bore me to tears and i cannot see any reason keep playing after 5 days i am sorry  expand
1129,in all honesty  the game is up to the usual par of nintendo quality  however  the local co op multiplayer might as well not exist  if you are looking to play with a partner  friend  family member  etc  do not expect more than simply running around behind them the whole time  it is confusing to me why they even put this option in  it is completely useless and ruins the experience 
1130,i actually just made a metacritic account just to review this game  this would be an almost perfect game if it was not for the one island per switch feature mixed with the first player to log in be in control of the entire game s progression for all players  this is an increasing issue if you actually have 8 players on the same switch each of the 8 players should have the ability toi actually just made a metacritic account just to review this game  this would be an almost perfect game if it was not for the one island per switch feature mixed with the first player to log in be in control of the entire game s progression for all players  this is an increasing issue if you actually have 8 players on the same switch each of the 8 players should have the ability to create their own island and be the representative of that island  controlling all progression of that island  additionally  players on the same switch should be able to buy houses on other players islands on the same switch  this would allow a player to have full control over one island and it is progression  and then also have up to 7 additional houses across 7 other islands on that switch console i enjoy playing on the shared island  but the locked island progression and missing out on that progression is killer to this game  the current system lets player 1 get the full game  with all other players only objective is noto complete nook miles worst part is nothere was not even a warning at the beginning of the game letting the players know that the first person to play gets full control  i think that is nothe most disappointing aspect of this situation  expand
1131,i really enjoy this game  i bought it as soon as it came out and started up my island  that evening my sister decided to pop in and play with me  we were baffled at the limitations of the second player  as we have progressed i keep finding things that she cannot do or participate in  i hate that she feels left out or completely unable to play with me  very annoying and sad 
1132,it would be a great game  if you would be able to create a new island for every player  but this way it is just not acceptable 
1133,not a real multiplayer game   do not buy as a family game or you will have frustrated players   only the first islander can play this game fully   all additional players can only play a partial version of the full game   they need to fix this bug   i bought this for my family and only 1 person gets access to play the full game   would not have bought if i had known and i have loved ac for years 
1134,seriously could have been one of the best animal crossing expierences yet  till the shameless and relentless greed of nintendo is once again thrown back in your face the moment you arealize in order to have more than one island  you need more than one switch  cmon  really  not cool
1135,fix the multiplayer and it d be a 10  this game is great but with a fundamentally broken multiplayer it is almost useless in regards to the original purchase reasoning  close to impossible to have meaningful play with my significant other and children  need the option to designate other players are island representatives with full control and ability 
1136,i am currently playing this game single player however i feel compelled to review this game based on the multiplayer experience  the decision to lock the game to one island per console is nothing short of a cash grab  i am a long time nintendo fan since i received a snes for christmas as a child but this behavior disgusts me and i am reluctant to spend any more money with this company ifi am currently playing this game single player however i feel compelled to review this game based on the multiplayer experience  the decision to lock the game to one island per console is nothing short of a cash grab  i am a long time nintendo fan since i received a snes for christmas as a child but this behavior disgusts me and i am reluctant to spend any more money with this company if they do not address this problem  nintendo consoles have always been family focused machines that encourage multiplayer and this seems to go against everything they have ever done to date sadly they have likely already sold enough units to cover costs and will simply ignore the outrage from their customers  expand
1137,only one island per switch  secondary switch profiles cannot make their own world  they can only play the game if they use the first world created  a stupid limitation  i would return this game if i could

1139,the game is great  kind of repetitive but you can overcome it anyway  i really liked the game but  my girlfriend liked it even more and there is the problem  i usually share my account with a sibling so my girlfriend  after seeing and playing the game with my account  decided to step up and buy the game for herself  even when i already had it just to play it with her profile  indeed  tothe game is great  kind of repetitive but you can overcome it anyway  i really liked the game but  my girlfriend liked it even more and there is the problem  i usually share my account with a sibling so my girlfriend  after seeing and playing the game with my account  decided to step up and buy the game for herself  even when i already had it just to play it with her profile  indeed  to share the island was great to her since we could be neighbors and she got familiarized with the island  but  there is just too much difference between the treatment i receive from the game and the one she gets  she just does not have any event for herself  they re all directed to me  so  even if you share  you actually share nothing and that s unpresentable  specially when we actually got two copies of the same game  so  while my original score was an 8 10  i just cannot forfeit the awful sharing system  expand

1143,best game so far this year  people need to stop review bombing games over something so small and petty 
1144,these negative reviews are insane  this is easily one of the greatest games released for the switch to date  playable hours will easily match and exceed games like botw

1156,money grubbing one island per switch feature demonstrates that the nintendo of today is no different than the eas of the world  nintendo would rather give themselves the chance to move more switch units than give their fans a proper game they can enjoy with their families during this notime of panic and uncertainty  do better nintendo

1161,dont play if you want to have your own island as opposed to sharing an island with someone with the same console  unbelievably stupid business decision  unless people are stupid enough to buy another console  wish i could return it but im the idiot who bought it digitally thru eshop
1162,while yes  being limited to one island per switch is pretty stupid  it is certainly not enough to make it a 0 10 game  new horizons is nothe best game in the series in my opinion  its looks gorgeous  it is fun and interactive  so relaxing and very polished  if you just want a layer back and chill experience  i highly recommend this game

1164,is incredible  i exceed my expectations and i am not concerned that it is only one island per console the game has always been like this forever 
1165,bought this for myself and my wife to play  but in nintendo s infinite wisdom they have decided that only one of us will ever get to enjoy the full experience  locking out anyone but the first player from making critical game decisions  at least my wife gets to play properly i have already had to quit

1185,my family and i  mom and two daughters  were really hyped about this game because we have all had very strong attachments to past installations to the franchise  we were very excited especially because this game came as a gift from my dear brother  but lo and behold the game locked my daughters from continuation in the game at all  older installations would share the players in the samemy family and i  mom and two daughters  were really hyped about this game because we have all had very strong attachments to past installations to the franchise  we were very excited especially because this game came as a gift from my dear brother  but lo and behold the game locked my daughters from continuation in the game at all  older installations would share the players in the same town  much like this game  but they do not stop normal progress to secondary players  the most secondary players would have to endure is dealing with whatever name the first player gave the town and sharing a house that could be altered by all of the players on the game  now  players cannot do so much as chop down a tree or purchase a haircut without going onto the primary account     usually these problems would be circumvented by buying another game cartridge to create a separate town  but nintendo has decided to make the game console exclusive  not cartridge exclusive which already has a hefty price of  60  but there is a required additional fee of  200 dollars minimum for a switch lite  which has very limited capabilities  or  300 dollars if you want a competent console  us players will expect to have to pay an additional  240 to  340 dollars should one person get their own chance at actually playing the game within a reasonable capacity that the advertisements and previous expectations nintendo has lead its audience to believe    maybe this could have been avoided because by simply not purchasing the game  but how should avid fans of the animal crossing expect this kind of product to come out as non multiplayer friendly  others could argue that with the last main game  new leaf  was single player and that new horizon is notechnically multiplayer because there are multiple players existing on the same island  keyword  existing  not playing  the game should be justifiably playable like  y know  a game  no less a  60 game  new leaf was advertised as your own experience and your own town because you are the mayor  this experience is uniquely yours and was advertised as so    maybe we are expecting too much  maybe it is too much to ask for autonomous gameplay for all of the players  despite that capability being apparent in other games on the switch such as pokémon and on older ac games on inferior consoles  despite the switch being capable of running beautifully rendered and complex games such as zelda botw  it must be too much for the game  sadly  we were advertised  very strongly might i add  that the game would be capable of multiplayer in its many advertisements  we were told many players can participate in nintendo s  island paradise  when the reality is nothat only one player with a sizable sum of money can experience this  island paradise  while the secondary players are basically forced to watch as this  paradise  taunts them for not paying the  300 gateway fee    i hope that future purchasers of the game take all of these points into account and choose to buy this game if they are buying for a single person because this game is by no means suitable for a family or even a pair of friends as turbulence can arise from there being only one person allowed to play the game  my family certainly experienced turbulence and i wish this game has never graced our home  furthermore  families with multiple switch consoles should wait until the price of the game drops dramatically because other games at a similar price offer so much more   tldr do not buy animal crossing new horizons if more than one person will play it  expand
1186,online multiplayer is painful with more than 2 player  the constant loading when player join and left leave you locked to loading screen  no online backup at launch is simply bad planning 
1187,player one being the only player that can actually access the entire game  in its full is one of the worse gaming mechanics i have ever come across  the fact that the game does not even allude to this is what makes it even suck even more  instant 0 from me for this as it completely ruins the experience for any other player other than the island representative  cheap  greedy move  do not evenplayer one being the only player that can actually access the entire game  in its full is one of the worse gaming mechanics i have ever come across  the fact that the game does not even allude to this is what makes it even suck even more  instant 0 from me for this as it completely ruins the experience for any other player other than the island representative  cheap  greedy move  do not even get me started on the pathetic attempt at local multiplayer  classic nintendo  expand

1189,fantastic   i cannot stop playing  it gives hours of pure fun  so much activities  infinity islands to explore  this game is so much worth it 
1190,this game is a solid 8 or 9  the one island per console thing does suck  but so does   review bombing so it gets a 10 from me to help offset the angry basement dwellers
1191,tiempos de carga son lentisimos para un juego con graficas inferiores a los de hoy en dia en juegos en un smarphone  lo compre y lo jugue 3 dias ahora quedara tirado por buen rato mucho hype pesima compra
1192,first time playing animal crossing   loving every minute locked inside the house  10 out of 10 no mistake  no issues with multi player
1193,the product shipped broken  starting the game with a different family member will load the save file of the person who started the game for the first time  this problem does not exist with other games on my switch  i wouldo not believe this issue will be fixed any faster than the mario maker s multiplayer problem  which still exist  i will update this review if things improve if the gamethe product shipped broken  starting the game with a different family member will load the save file of the person who started the game for the first time  this problem does not exist with other games on my switch  i wouldo not believe this issue will be fixed any faster than the mario maker s multiplayer problem  which still exist  i will update this review if things improve if the game worked  it would be a fantastic game to get the family during this whole quarentine event  expand

1195,the game is beautiful and very charming  but the fact that you can only have one single island per console is nototally ruining the experience for us at home  the three of us  kid  wife and me  were so looking forward to this game  only to be terribly disappointed to find that only the creator of the island can progress through the story of the game worst of all  a new copy of the gamethe game is beautiful and very charming  but the fact that you can only have one single island per console is nototally ruining the experience for us at home  the three of us  kid  wife and me  were so looking forward to this game  only to be terribly disappointed to find that only the creator of the island can progress through the story of the game worst of all  a new copy of the game will not fix this problem  only buying another nintendo switch console  two new consoles in our case to be precise  would do  this is absolutely crazy in 2020  please nintendo fix this nonsense  expand
1196,llevo jugando a animal crossing desde gamecube y éste seguramente sea el mejor de la saga  son muchos los añadidos para la ocasión  mantiene la esencia y potencia lo que lo hacía único  así es como se mejora un juego que ya era bueno  bravísimo 
1197,although the game is fun and relaxing  i bought it purely for the multiplayer couch coop with my wife  where the game excels in single player gameplay it falls flat on its face with couch coop multiplayer  it is so painful to play together we have resorted to taking turns playing single player  wish ac would ve gotten this right maybe an update in the future will make it morealthough the game is fun and relaxing  i bought it purely for the multiplayer couch coop with my wife  where the game excels in single player gameplay it falls flat on its face with couch coop multiplayer  it is so painful to play together we have resorted to taking turns playing single player  wish ac would ve gotten this right maybe an update in the future will make it more enjoyable for families to play together  expand

1199,this game is excellent  lots of these bad reviews are not accurate  multi player is amazingly fun  but yes does require a second switch   not unlike how gameboys have always been  the game doesnt box you in with quests  help build up your own island community  decorate where ever you want  ignore the bad reviews 
1200,i created a metacritic account just so i could rant about this game the island sharing is stupid  i play a lot faster than my sister and so she isn t getting to do as much of the stuff as i am and she is angry about it  will nintendo fix it  i kinda doubt it  and anyways the damage is already done 
1201,love the game  people should stop whining about one island per switch and learn to share and team play instead  while there are some minor minuses  loading time when travel or no split iscreen in multiplayer  this game is still an amazing update and makes it the best game in the series

1205, 60 is a lot of money to spend for only one person to be able to have a well rounded experience on a video game  i have two sisters who also were excited to play the game  but despite them both having their own nintendo accounts and online accounts too  they were booted up onto my island with not much to do  i considered even buying them their own copies of the game  but upon further 60 is a lot of money to spend for only one person to be able to have a well rounded experience on a video game  i have two sisters who also were excited to play the game  but despite them both having their own nintendo accounts and online accounts too  they were booted up onto my island with not much to do  i considered even buying them their own copies of the game  but upon further investigation that isn t enough to allow them to play their own game  so if we all wanted to have our own islands  we would each need to buy our own switch and copies of the game  this is so ridiculous  it iseriously ruined the experience of the game for me  and obviously my sisters too  not about to drop  600  just for us to play a game together  i cannot believe nintendo set it up like this  isn t it enough to have bought one system  already  300  a decent chunk of money  each of us to be paying for our own online subscriptions  and to have gotten the  60 game disc  they need to fix this asap i wouldo like the game  but like i said  it is hard to enjoy when i live with two other people who also wanted to be able to play  expand
1206,a decent addition to the franchise marred by unfortunate and needless limitations in order to sell more switch consoles  this will backfire on nintendo  probably cost nintendo more money in the long run as will the mediocre pokemon games i cannot see nintendo continuing to sell mediocre or flawed products moving forward  especially when better options exist   tamtam  stardew valley 
1207,its a lovely single player game with great writing however the multiplayer aspect is just a mess  absolute mess  it is poorly explained what you can and cant do as a non primary resident or visitor and you cant do a lot so single player only give it an 8 
1208,hey  first time reviewer  i know that s gonna auto discount my review in some eyes  but i have just never been insulted by a game enough that i felt the need to actually make an account and warn people  so please  take it from me  a genuine end user  it is not just pointless negativity  something tells me the critics never played multiplayer  these dev s are trying to   you  now with thathey  first time reviewer  i know that s gonna auto discount my review in some eyes  but i have just never been insulted by a game enough that i felt the need to actually make an account and warn people  so please  take it from me  a genuine end user  it is not just pointless negativity  something tells me the critics never played multiplayer  these dev s are trying to   you  now with that out of the way  let us proceed animal crossing  new horizons promises to let you travel to and inhabit a deserted island  it reels you in by telling you  it will not be like before  we swear  like an abusive ex do not worry you will be able to move houses and services at your leisure   eventually and for 30k 50k per building  you will be able to terraform  the island to your vision   again  eventually  and not anything on the shores  you can even live there with your whole family   if you wouldo not mind anyone besides the first resident being treated like glorified visitors with a house oh but only one island per switch guys because  we want everyone to buy their own switch   in a global recession because the average family has tons of excess money right now  and definitely are not all living way below the poverty line  greetings from america here is what they do not tell you 1  only the first resident can advance the main plot points  and unlock those features they lured you in with  if you are not first resident  you will not even be able to see the recipe s for the objects furniture you will be forced to craft  in order to advance the plot 2  you have to build everything on this island for everyone one  do not invite people to live there cause it is gonna be you grinding all day e ery day for the resources  not really the island vacation package it was sold as 3  there is inconvenience baked into the game  half of the upgrades just get rid of some annoying inconvenience that you were just putting up with  advance the plot  if you are first resident  to have a slightly less miserable time  i think that s a really lazy and corrupt form of game progression  used only by those that lack the imagination necessary to offer genuinely fulfilling progression rewards  i ts like hide and seek but you get to remove your blindfold after thirty games  or something also ignore any excuse that these annoyances are in the game to ensure fairness  because there are already many money exploits in the game  so in the end it is kinda like the games for windows live disaster of yore  you know  that time when microsoft thought it was cool to sabotage the stability and enjoyment of their games in the hopes of preventing piracy  which happened anyways   hamstringing your product to preserve fairness is a fools errand  you might as well ask the sun not to rise so the main issue is  if you buy this game you are telling nintendo that this is an okay business model  naw it is cool  us consumers are total suckers  hey if another zelda game comes out make sure that only the first person on the console to play the game can advance the plot  so you can force us to buy more switches other than all that total bs  it had some pretty enjoyable aspects  for one  you wouldo not need to take a freaking personality test to change your hair color   these developers are asinine  and everything was pretty much 24 7 until we made progress   then it went back to their traditional stance of    night owls  but as soon as i found out the game was just gonna treat me like a chump indefinitely  like unpaid labor  it kinda drained any aspect of working for fun from the game  expand

1220,this is essentially a remake of the original animal crossing and it is beyond amazing  i know a lot of people are mad because they have to share their island with the people that they actually physically live with in the real world but that s how animal crossing games have always been  back in the day you could add people you lived with to your town but you could only play one at a time this is essentially a remake of the original animal crossing and it is beyond amazing  i know a lot of people are mad because they have to share their island with the people that they actually physically live with in the real world but that s how animal crossing games have always been  back in the day you could add people you lived with to your town but you could only play one at a time  now you can actually have two people play at the same time which is  like i said before  amazing  if you wouldo not wish to exist on the same island as the people you live with i would not blame the game for that  seems like that is something that is a much deeper more personal issue  expand

1235,i love animal crossing always have and i am sure i always will  my sister  mom and i have been playing since the first one on gamecube and all of the games have been super fun this one included but it dosen t seem the same it feels like its too different  its still a fun game but i think they could ve done better  i will continue to play for along time im sure  of it but my family and ii love animal crossing always have and i am sure i always will  my sister  mom and i have been playing since the first one on gamecube and all of the games have been super fun this one included but it dosen t seem the same it feels like its too different  its still a fun game but i think they could ve done better  i will continue to play for along time im sure  of it but my family and i agree that they didnt  need to change it this much but the game is still enjoyable  expand
1236,i loved this game as i started it up  it was so beautiful and seemed to be everything i wanted in an animal crossing game then the grind started  you need iron to unlock the recipes to explore your whole island  but you cannot easily get enough iron to do that unless you can reach the rocks on the inaccessible parts of the island  so you harvest what little you can each day beforei loved this game as i started it up  it was so beautiful and seemed to be everything i wanted in an animal crossing game then the grind started  you need iron to unlock the recipes to explore your whole island  but you cannot easily get enough iron to do that unless you can reach the rocks on the inaccessible parts of the island  so you harvest what little you can each day before being forced to wait till the next day to harvest more  and all the while  your tools are breaking  which costs iron to replace  slowing your progress when you finally do unlock the ladder to explore the whole island  you are tasked with wasting much  much more of your precious resources building stupid crap for npc neighbors this game has a lot going for it  but so  so much of the great content is locked behind arbitrary  frustrating  grindy nonsense  when you are the only character in the game capable of any decision making  crafting  or planning of any sort  it gets tedious fast  it would not be so bad if you could  purchase  some of the resources you need  but you cannot  you have to build the tools to harvest them  you have to harvest them  you have to build the furniture with them  you have to choose where the furniture goes  you have to do everything yourself if you want to unlock everything the game has to offer nintendo promised us an animal crossing game where we  could  completely customize every square inch of the island sadly  what they delivered is an animal crossing game where you are  forced  to customize every square inch of the island this issue combined with the irredeemably stupid choices surrounding cloud saves and multiplayer make this one of the most disappointing games i have ever paid full price for  5 105 10  expand
1237,this game is not a good and fun experience for anybody who shares their switch  the person who creates the island is nothe only one allowed to do anything and they re having a good time  as anybody after the island creator  you are just allowed to pay off your loans

1242,bought this for my wife and she loves it  i wanted to play so we could share the experience only to find out i could not have my own island  looking into second players on this game seems to be pointless as they cannot actually do anything  would be a stellar review  from what i have seen of my wife playing  if not for this ridiculous one island rule 
1243,after a week  i honestly regret playing this game at all  i put up with the slow early pacing  the clumsy core gameplay elements  effectively untouched since the gamecube days  and the tedious and dull crafting system  because the level of creative potential that new horizons promised was incredibly tantalizing  but like some sort of sisyphean hell  true creative freedom is agonizinglyafter a week  i honestly regret playing this game at all  i put up with the slow early pacing  the clumsy core gameplay elements  effectively untouched since the gamecube days  and the tedious and dull crafting system  because the level of creative potential that new horizons promised was incredibly tantalizing  but like some sort of sisyphean hell  true creative freedom is agonizingly restricted by the poorly thought out mechanics  leaving me feeling miserable for having wasted my time in the first place new horizons  most prominent additions are hamstrung by half baked  outdated  inconvenient  and unintuitive design decisions  making them far too frustrating or shallow to be worthwhile the new terraforming tools  for example  give an unparalleled ability to treat the island as your personal canvas  however  by the time you unlock them  your town will be populated by around 15 buildings such as stores and homes  many of which you will likely want to move once you gain the ability to freely create rivers and paths  in stardew valley  a  15 indie game developed primarily by a single person  the interface for moving farm buildings is incredibly simple and convenient  pick up a building  and pop it down where you want it  boom  done  in new horizons  moving a building to an altogether new location involves paying a substantial sum of money  50 000 bells  and waiting overnight  it is even worse if you wish to only move a building slightly  as you have no choice but to first move it isomewhere else  then move it back where you want it  requiring  100 000 bells and two days  and you can only move one building a day  i play with time traveling  yet having to wait day after day after day to move multiple buildings around is still incredibly obnoxious even for me  i am sorry for anyone who s actually trying to play this game in real time another botched new feature is nothe crafting system  tools break incredibly quickly  and crafting more is an obnoxiously slow process  resource gathering is shallow and awkward  amounting to little more than brainlessly smacking rocks and trees  for some ungodly reason  a crafting bench placed in your house cannot use resources you ve stored in your home s sole storage menu  meaning you have to pointlessly retrieve and later re store multiple types of materials every single time you go to craft  in summary  the crafting system is incredibly half baked  pointlessly time wasting  and the minor benefit of being able to craft some simple furniture is capsized by the disastrously tedious tool replacement loop new horizons allows you to switch between a front view camera angle  as seen in new leaf  and a more top down angle  similar to the gamecube version  this is a huge improvement over previous entries in this series  and yet still comically half baked by the standards of the broader industry  why cannot animal crossing just have the same camera controls that have been standard in third person 3d games for 20 years  expand
1244,i wish this game was more of a proper multiplayer game  i cannot enjoy ac nh with my sister because of how restrictive it is  playing this as single player is not what i bought the game for 
1245,i have been a huge fan of the animal crossing franchise ever since the original on the gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non stop  i think i can say that it is definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt   the game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your islandi have been a huge fan of the animal crossing franchise ever since the original on the gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non stop  i think i can say that it is definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt   the game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your island down to the ground and water beneath your feet   never before have i felt so free in an animal crossing game for how much i love the game  there are of course some downsides that many other users also are reporting   the biggest of which that everyone and their dog is notalking about is nothe 1 island per switch thing   now to be fair  this isn t unusual for the franchise  it has almost always been a 1 town per console game ever since the original on the gamecube   other than my sister who plays this game on occasion  i am the only one playing so i am not really affected too much   normally i would forgive this nothough since it is nothing new  i would forgive it if it were not for the other issue that everyone is notalking about being the limited co op   this is a relatively new issue that started in new leaf  where being the second player sucked because all the cool things that allowed you to customize and play to your heart s content was exclusive to the first player  so it made being anything other than the first player essentially boring and pointless   i would ve expected nintendo to be smarter this notime around and remove that pesky quirk  there is no reason you cannot have more than one mayor or an assistant mayor island representative that is capable of doing everything that the first player can do except maybe delete the island  but i guess that did not cross their minds for whatever reason   again like i said  i basically am the only one who plays this game so i am not really blowing a fuse over this but for anyone with siblings or loved ones who also play this game a lot  i can see how it is so frustrating   in this situation  the problem is not so much that nintendo is behind the times  they are but still  the problem is more like nintendo taking 3 steps back when it comes to co op this notime around other than that  i think the positives still out weight the negatives by a longshot   the freedom to customize and change almost everything about your island is a huge positive   all of the new additions are certainly welcome and the amount of quality of life changes regarding the menuing  the inventory system  the abd and shopping  etc  make me wonder why i put up with the problems in new leaf for so long   the graphics are pure eye candy  places like the museum are simply beautiful on the switch to look at   playing with friends online is also a pleasant experience  although i wouldo wish it was possible to play on other people s islands outside of your friends list for anyone who allowed that option   overall  it is a pretty great game for anyone who s new to the series despite its flaws  it is a must have for anyone with a switch imo  expand
1246,by far  this is nothe most inventive version of animal crossing  as someone who s been playing since 2002  and by proxy grew up with this franchise  i love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason  there are problems  but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be  diy being the main gimmick putsby far  this is nothe most inventive version of animal crossing  as someone who s been playing since 2002  and by proxy grew up with this franchise  i love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason  there are problems  but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be  diy being the main gimmick puts the control directly into your hands  so you get to build the island in the most literal way possible  certain construction projects still require you to wait a day before getting to use it  but that s nothing a little time travel cannot fix  time travel  though i personally do not like it  circumvents most problems that come with how this franchise s progression works  and while some people just want to max out their town as soon as possible  animal crossing has only ever worked when there is something important to do  when you complete everything  what else is nothere  so  if not for this flaw that all animal crossing games suffer from  it d be a 9 10  only having one island per switch is annoying  yeah  but at the same time  is it really a reason to give a rating that should be reserved for games like sonic the hedgehog  2006  or crappy movie based games like shark tales  at worst this game is a 5 10  at best it is an 8 10  clearly  nintendo should ve made islands pertain to the profiles and not the system  but this game is such a perfect sequel to the previous games  new horizons was made for a certain kind of experience  a one player experience  in which you could do almost anything yourself  i have not shared a system in years as these games and systems became more personalized and tailored to this kind of experience  which puts my score into perspective  but that does not mean i excuse it is flaws  i certainly feel for those who cannot afford a second console and i want better for those who are stuck in that shared purgatory  but video games in general have come to a point where everyone has to have their own system  something that was very prevalent with handheld systems like the ds that only ever allowed one profile  wireless connectivity has taken over and it is no longer the days where you would simply have your own memory card and put it into slot b  then plug in your second controller  so few games do this anymore where you can just grab a second controller and play split iscreen or do anything of the sort  i cannot say whether it is good or bad that games are like this now  but for my personal experience with this game  i give an 8 10  expand
1247,this game is just addicting  it is hard to put down when you start  it may be one town per console  but it is been like that since the gamecube version  this game deserves way more credit  graphics are amazing  crafting is fun  etc
1248,amazing game that is just too close to perfection there are not a lot of negatives  so let us start with them first off  you already know where this is going  if you wouldid not start the island  if you want to contribute to the island  you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader  that kind of sucks  i wouldo not have a problem with it as i play with my family  butamazing game that is just too close to perfection there are not a lot of negatives  so let us start with them first off  you already know where this is going  if you wouldid not start the island  if you want to contribute to the island  you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader  that kind of sucks  i wouldo not have a problem with it as i play with my family  but i would imagine siblings having issues with this  do keep this in mind before buying if this is important the other issue i have with this game is nothe first week or so  it is sloooow  even for an animal crossing game  it was kind of tempting to time travel at a few points  if you pick up the game  stick it out until the upgraded resident services building is built  it does pick up from there as far as negatives go  that s all i got  now here are a few things i love about the game first of all  the game has a ton to do  from decorating your island to designing shirts  hats  and dresses  you will never run out of things to do  that  along with unlockable features and buildings all along the way  you will find yourself popping in every day  and getting sucked into it and next thing you know it is dinner time also  the online exists  its like new leaf s online  not great  but eh  it works all in all  i would 100  reccomend picking up the game  ignore the butthurt review bombers who read an article on kokatu and suddenly hate the game over something that hardly applies to them  if nintendo fixed the way the island sharing works to allow non leader residents to contribute more  this game would break the review scale  expand

1250,a huge disappointment and let down because of a bizarre decision to have one island per switch with all important progress and gameplay mechanics tied to the first account that plays it context is important here as people seem to be dismissing this issue as not important  co op and multiplayer is not the issue  as some people might want to play the way it is implemented  the issue isa huge disappointment and let down because of a bizarre decision to have one island per switch with all important progress and gameplay mechanics tied to the first account that plays it context is important here as people seem to be dismissing this issue as not important  co op and multiplayer is not the issue  as some people might want to play the way it is implemented  the issue is nothat any other account on the system that plays after the first person to open the game is forced to play a lesser experience that happens to be shackled to the multiplayer experience  it is nothen not an equapl  stand alone playthrough with all the features of one a lot of reviews are fair in their scores because they played the full game with no problems on one account  that is fine  but a lot of people have more than one account on their switch  to say that the opinions on the game by people affected by this are unfounded is frankly ignorant and it does not address the core problem it is 2020 and we cannot have multiple accounts play their own instance of a game  yes we can  nintendo has just chosen not to here  for a game that is notrying to be a calming community experience  it has only made me feel conned and frustrated and left out because of this as someone who is sharing the game with someone in my household  however being the second account to play  i am forced to be an observer to someone elses enjoyment of the game  if you are not the first person to play this game on your switch you might as well not play it at all as you wouldo not get the full experience  that is unless you buy another switch to have the privilege this is a frankly disgusting and pointless choice that only serves to ruin the experience for many people who buy the game and line the pockets of nintendo  even the person who played it first feels guilty for playing it  even though they had no control other it be wary before buying this game  unless you play on your own switch  first  on your account from the outset  you will not have the full experience you expected when you bought it  i will be extremely hesitant to buy any future nintendo games because of this on a positive note  the person who first started playing on their account on my switch says it is a lovely game  shame i cannot play what they re playing  expand
1251,ideally this would be like the gamecube version  where every player could have their own island  but that s not horrible by itself   what s horrible is only allowing one player per console to be the real player  while everyone else gets half a game   i own hundreds of games and i cannot think of a single other game designed as a one player per console game   this would be inexplicableideally this would be like the gamecube version  where every player could have their own island  but that s not horrible by itself   what s horrible is only allowing one player per console to be the real player  while everyone else gets half a game   i own hundreds of games and i cannot think of a single other game designed as a one player per console game   this would be inexplicable if it was not nintendo  expand

1267,disgusting limits on a single switch  do not buy until they address it  you cannot progress until the first player do too sign in does  60  for that  really 
1268,this game is as wonderfully entertaining as it is broken in forcing people to buy multiple switches and copies of the game to play it to it is fullest  nintendo are being completely trash with the way save games are being handled with this game and forcing only one island per console 
1269,i have nothing to say i expected better the game itself   great but  the giant downfall is 1 island per console   i thought the nintendo switch was a shared console plz fix this with an update only if this was fixed i would need nothing else and would give the score straight up a 10 
1270,the 1 island per console concept ruined the game for me  i cannot fully enjoy the game now or progress at my own pace since it will all be controlled by the first player and on the reverse side  if i was the first player  i would be forced to progress for the next player i know nintendo does not care but i had hope they would not do this again like with every other animal crossing game the 1 island per console concept ruined the game for me  i cannot fully enjoy the game now or progress at my own pace since it will all be controlled by the first player and on the reverse side  if i was the first player  i would be forced to progress for the next player i know nintendo does not care but i had hope they would not do this again like with every other animal crossing game  welp  there is always the next one  expand
1271,experience from the whole game was ruined by the fact that second player is just a barely more than a visitor  they cannot do anything that is going to make an impact on the game moving forward  if this whole cash grab strategy with one island is fixed  then the game is 10 10
1272,would easily be a 9 or 10  if i wasnt completely unable to progress for letting my little sister play first  meaning she is resident rep  she swears she is never asked to complete the tasks needed  or else it is unclear   all i can do is spend nook miles to farm resources before handing the console back to her  worse still  only the resident rep is given crafting recipes  so no ladder forwould easily be a 9 or 10  if i wasnt completely unable to progress for letting my little sister play first  meaning she is resident rep  she swears she is never asked to complete the tasks needed  or else it is unclear   all i can do is spend nook miles to farm resources before handing the console back to her  worse still  only the resident rep is given crafting recipes  so no ladder for me  would like to know went diving is gone to  as we were looking forward to it  expand
1273,a fun game that i really wanted to play but what a   multiplayer mode  having only one island would not be that much of a problem if all players could contribute to quests  but here  the game is just for one person  there is absolutely no interest for the other players 
1274,fix the only one island per console  i honestly would not even care if i had to buy another game  but really you ve got to be kidding me  ridiculous  there is no player 2 in this game  you wouldo not get to play  you are living off someone else s game  totally missing your mark  losing fans  losing customers  losing the people that made this 3x larger in sales than your other games  honestly fix the only one island per console  i honestly would not even care if i had to buy another game  but really you ve got to be kidding me  ridiculous  there is no player 2 in this game  you wouldo not get to play  you are living off someone else s game  totally missing your mark  losing fans  losing customers  losing the people that made this 3x larger in sales than your other games  honestly  where do you get off i wouldoubt people will come back next time for animal crossing if this isn t fixed  expand
1275,i would like to get into the meat of the game  but i cannot get past the extremely stupid decision to limit one island per switch  per switch  i have not gotten into an animal crossing game since the gamecube version  which did not have this limitation  it is typical nintendo  for anything they do right  they have to do something wrong to balance it out if you plan on only playing one player i would like to get into the meat of the game  but i cannot get past the extremely stupid decision to limit one island per switch  per switch  i have not gotten into an animal crossing game since the gamecube version  which did not have this limitation  it is typical nintendo  for anything they do right  they have to do something wrong to balance it out if you plan on only playing one player  you are probably fine  but for anyone in a household with one switch and multiple players  you are in for a bad time  expand
1276,i was really looking forward to this game however  there is one terrible and well documented caveat  one island per switch the year is 2020 ad  and nintendo who claims to be the most family friendly console in existence has made a terrible decision fueled by their corporate greed  i wanted my wife to play this game too but she cannot because she ll be a glorified second classi was really looking forward to this game however  there is one terrible and well documented caveat  one island per switch the year is 2020 ad  and nintendo who claims to be the most family friendly console in existence has made a terrible decision fueled by their corporate greed  i wanted my wife to play this game too but she cannot because she ll be a glorified second class citizen of my personally created island and will be unable to make her own full progress and island creations unless we purchase another switch exclusively for her to play  plus another copy of the game i continue to question how people are not as bothered by this as they should be  the level of greed in this company has officially reached ea levels  imagine  being a parent and having 3 kids who share one switch guess what  they re screwed because kids are not known for being agreeable  messing with another kid s landscape  or building in places where another kid may not want structures  the list goes on and on nintendo fanboys will defend this decision  that was made in the interests of their corporate overlords  not for them  or you  or me  as normal in the animal crossing universe or as an overreaction by those affected by it  guys  these are legitimate concerns and perfectly good reasons to be angry  i cannot think of another game that requires me to purchase another console if i want to share it with my household  because that s the reason console profiles are a thing since last gen consoles it is highly unlikely nintendo will remedy this ridiculous situation  however  it is 100  fair for people to express their disdain by using this platform to voice their reasons for giving the game a 0  our complaints are just as legitimate as the critic reviews who gave this game a 10  despite the obvious limitation at hand which seems suspect  maybe those reviews are paid  who knows  as well as voting with their wallets for some however  it is impossible to vote with their wallets if they have already purchased the game and have no recourse for a refund  which is pretty much everyone that s okay  nintendo is crying laughing about this on their way to the bank and they know they can get away with this because you will gladly take nintendo s virtual spit in the face and thank them for it  expand
1277,pretty good game  having a lot of fun personally  but i cannot in good faith give a good review considering the hard limitations in this game  and some of the tediousness it is extremely annoying that there is only one island per switch  and to top it all off  only the first player can actually even do anything on said island  i love this game  so much i wish i could make a second islandpretty good game  having a lot of fun personally  but i cannot in good faith give a good review considering the hard limitations in this game  and some of the tediousness it is extremely annoying that there is only one island per switch  and to top it all off  only the first player can actually even do anything on said island  i love this game  so much i wish i could make a second island to make it completely different from my own  and besides my issues  there is a ton of people out there who s switches are in households  households with more than one person  imagine a family with twins  or siblings  who get this game  only one of them can play  and yeah  sorry but not everyone can   afford two or more consoles and to my second point  the tediousness  i wouldo not generally mind games being grind y  i playing monster hunter for god s sake  but having to craft each fish bait individually   sucks ass  i appreciate them at least giving a fast forward on the crafting cut scene  but having to go through it   all 5 menus just to craft one item at a time is flat garbage  not to mention it is just  time consuming in all the wrong ways  want to make a good fishing rod  well guess what bud  you wouldo not have a recipe for 5 sticks and 1 iron  you have to go through the cut scene twice because for some dumb   reason nothing is streamlined it d be such a better experience if you could a  bulk craft items like fish bait  and b  have not just  upgrade  recipes but also streamlined recipes where i could just make a fishing rod straight up with 5 sticks and 1 iron  the same amount it costs already  without the hassle anyways yeah do not buy this game if you have more than one ac fan in your house  or get prepared to buy new islands for  200 minimum lol  expand
1278,the game is okay for me  except for some frustrating mechanics and painfully slow menu screens and loading times   however  this game just shafts my gf  who i am playing couch co op with   she has no access to island advancements  and is missing all storyline diy recipes   which is a lot   it is a shame nintendo came out with such an unfinished multiplayer   it iseems like it was an afterthought 
1279,nintendo has ruined this game with their greed  if you share a console with anyone do not buy this game as only one player is allowed to enjoy the game per console  even if you buy a second copy it will still only let you play one save per switch  not only that but the second player only counts as a visitor and cannot contribute anything to the island besides gathering supplies  ridiculousnintendo has ruined this game with their greed  if you share a console with anyone do not buy this game as only one player is allowed to enjoy the game per console  even if you buy a second copy it will still only let you play one save per switch  not only that but the second player only counts as a visitor and cannot contribute anything to the island besides gathering supplies  ridiculous decision by nintendo  expand
1280,this game is nototally good  except for that one island feature  i cannot play ac  new horizons without waiting for my girlfriend comming from work and continue playing  cause she is nothe major    system
1281,you can only create one island per nintendo switch system  even if you use multiple games  a different system is required to create a different island if you have a family that plays nintendo switch then do not buy animal crossing we areserved the game hoping for a good experience but no  people should have a choice one of us will not be able to play the game and for obvious reasonsyou can only create one island per nintendo switch system  even if you use multiple games  a different system is required to create a different island if you have a family that plays nintendo switch then do not buy animal crossing we areserved the game hoping for a good experience but no  people should have a choice one of us will not be able to play the game and for obvious reasons none of us would feel well deleting our save in order for the other to play the game is cool  though not being able to live in your individual world   and that s not the last of it    makes it impossible for others to play so one of us will not be able to play the game  and no  we wont buy another switch it is also of worth to mention that for me its a 0 10 cause i cannot simply play it  expand
1282,the fact only one person gets to play per switch is insulting  what about if i have two kids  returning this money grab of a game  shame on you 
1283,my family cannot even play the game to it is fullest because they only give you one island for the entire switch and only one person can play the game to it is fullest do not buy this game
1284,i bought this game expecting that my girlfriend and i could play together and enjoy our island together  since we spend a lot of time apart at work or taking care of different chores  this felt like it could be a nice way to have a shared activity  if asynchronous  and chat about it later on  i was wrong not only do you get limited to a single island per switch  which is a bummer i bought this game expecting that my girlfriend and i could play together and enjoy our island together  since we spend a lot of time apart at work or taking care of different chores  this felt like it could be a nice way to have a shared activity  if asynchronous  and chat about it later on  i was wrong not only do you get limited to a single island per switch  which is a bummer  absolutely unacceptable in 2020  but i knew that going in  but the game is only for the first person to create the island  that s right  if you are the second person to jump in  you cannot do anything  you essentially walk around aimlessly  what an absolutely garbage system so i bought a game that only one of us can enjoy  if you thought this could be a fun time for more than one person  this game is not for you  it certainly was not for me  expand

1286,i am the second player  which is horrible  i have found out  four days in  why i have not been progressing  player 1 has all of the power  player 2 just gets to sit back and watch things happen  i wouldo not mind sharing an island   i think it is a great idea  but human villagers should have equal rights  i am done playing this  i hope player 1 enjoys the experience alone 
1287,normally nintendo releases games in great condition with minimal issues on release  however with new horizons i am frustrated with how rushed the game s multiplayer functions  it truly feels as if the game was designed for only one player in mind  with the split iscreen added last second  the first player to play the game being the only person able to make any progress to the island makesnormally nintendo releases games in great condition with minimal issues on release  however with new horizons i am frustrated with how rushed the game s multiplayer functions  it truly feels as if the game was designed for only one player in mind  with the split iscreen added last second  the first player to play the game being the only person able to make any progress to the island makes zero sense  until you arealize that it is one island per switch console  making it obvious that nintendo is doing it for the money  being the second player to play the game absolutely sucks  you cannot even pick up items off the ground and have them go to your own inventory  you have to pass leader back and forth and if you accidentally pick up something while not being the leader  you have to go retrieve it from a recycle bin  the second player cannot even open their own inventory to equip items  they have to cycle through their favorites with x  and if you pass what you want you have to cycle through them all again  it just feels completely clunky when you are not playing as leader  i wouldo not understand why they did not simply allow the second player to also have inventory access  even if it is one player at a time  it also makes no sense at all why each account cannot make their own island  even if you buy 2 copies of the game  the second copy is essentially scrap because its all tied to the console itself  bottom line is in order to let more than one person have the full game experience  they also must purchase an additional switch console for their self  which is extremely greedy of nintendo to do  expand
1288,really fun and relaxing game if you are the only one playing it on the nintendo switch  do not buy if you have others who want to play the game without their own switch  anybody else besides the first person to play the game on a single console is going to have a bad time  it is a single player game disguised as a multiplayer game  each console shares an island so if the first player doesreally fun and relaxing game if you are the only one playing it on the nintendo switch  do not buy if you have others who want to play the game without their own switch  anybody else besides the first person to play the game on a single console is going to have a bad time  it is a single player game disguised as a multiplayer game  each console shares an island so if the first player does all the things  there is nothing left for the other players to do and they cannot start their own island  there is only one shame on the designers or whomever decided that this was a good restriction to have  it is supposedly to curb cheating  cheating  in a non competitive game  instead it just harms the others who would like to have their own island and make their own choices   it also makes nintendo look greedy because the only way to get your own experience in a family is noto have multiple switch consoles and multiple copies of the game i hope they get the message that people are really unhappy with this and feel swindled  fix it please nintendo  expand
1289,i am not a fan that their can only be one island per switch  i hope they fix this soon 
1290,edit isome people just refuse to understand the situation so im going to copy it directly from nintendo support is nothere a way to create multiple islands you can only create one island per nintendo switch system  even if you use multiple games  a different system is required to create a different island the island save data is saved on the nintendo switch system  so there will onlyedit isome people just refuse to understand the situation so im going to copy it directly from nintendo support is nothere a way to create multiple islands you can only create one island per nintendo switch system  even if you use multiple games  a different system is required to create a different island the island save data is saved on the nintendo switch system  so there will only be one island  save file  even if different games are used on the same system if i purchase a second system  can i transfer the save file  island data  to a different console animal crossing  new horizons does not support the ability to transfer your save file from one nintendo switch system to another is nothis game compatible with save data cloud this game does not support the save data cloud functionality of nintendo switch online when multiple players live on one island  does everyone have access to the same places and items there are some tasks on the island that the resident representative  first resident on the island  must complete before the related features will be open to other players  for example  only the resident representative can receive and set up blathers  museum tent it is not possible to reassign the resident representative role to another player  if certain places or items in the game are not available for island residents  have the resident representative progress to the point where the item or feature is available for them  then try again so for people who are trying to defend this by saying this was always the case with the franchise  firstly its not true  secondly its frikkin 2020  there is literally no logical reason for not letting people have multiple save files  the only reason is noto make people buy new consoles if you intend to play alone  lucky you  but most of us do not  think of a couple or a family with kids  do not tell me they should buy a new console for each family member just because the franchise was always like this  im sorry  but this is just bs original review  was looking forward to play this with my wife  then i came across the information that the game is limited to one save per system  so not even buying two copies of the game is enough  i would need to buy another switch just for this game  wtf director aya kyogoku and producer hisashi nogami   why dont you want me to buy your game  expand
1291,well i cannot play the properly game since i let my sister play before me  i either have to delete her save and be a terrible brother or just let her play the game unless i buy another switch nice one nintendo 
1292,typical nintendo being 2 decades behind the times when it comes to basic features we expect from games  one island per console  the people who share the island with the pprimary owner end up getting a half baked experience   this game should allow multiple account dave s on a console  like every game for the past 20 years 
1293,the fact that they force you to buy another switch to actually be able to enjoy the game if you are not the primary player is so greedy i have never seen anything like that  disappointed 
1294,i like the game  would rate it a lot higher  if it were not for the shared island or one mayor of the island thing  my gf started our island  and i would not have a problem with her being the mayor and all  i even like the fact that we share the island but i cannot even contribute to building the houses for the new residents which made my interest in the game drop immensely  feels like thei like the game  would rate it a lot higher  if it were not for the shared island or one mayor of the island thing  my gf started our island  and i would not have a problem with her being the mayor and all  i even like the fact that we share the island but i cannot even contribute to building the houses for the new residents which made my interest in the game drop immensely  feels like the first player is getting a lot more out of the game which sucks in my opinion  at least make it optional so everyone can contribute and everyone gets the same furniture and all  expand
1295,i wouldo not even care that the same console players must stay on the same island  my daughter is nothe primary resident and i take over after bed time  thinking i would advance through the games stages for the both of us  after paying of home loans  banking more than 100k in bells  and finding more that 25 species in less than a week  i was stumped as to why i could not get the recipe for an axi wouldo not even care that the same console players must stay on the same island  my daughter is nothe primary resident and i take over after bed time  thinking i would advance through the games stages for the both of us  after paying of home loans  banking more than 100k in bells  and finding more that 25 species in less than a week  i was stumped as to why i could not get the recipe for an ax or shovel  i even banked up additional miles to buy the diy recipe pack in the miles store  only to find out that i still need those original flimsy diy recipes to even access them  after much frustration and research   i realized what the problem was  so now i have to what   go into my daughters account  get her through the stages so we both have access to new things  so what is nothe point of having multiple players   who would ever think this was a good idea   i am sure as hell not buying another console just to have my own island in the middle of a global pandemic  bad form  expand
1296,the fact that they restrict multiplayer options so much is just sad  hopefully nintendo notices the review bombing and actually updates the game to have fewer restrictions
1297,while the game is beautiful  and the game play is well designed i cannot over look nintendo s greed  the fact that there is only one island  per switch is disappointing  it would not be so bad if every player  after the first was not restricted  from doing in game story content  with out these story missions  the 2and player misses out on most diy recipes  and cannot contribute  to buildingwhile the game is beautiful  and the game play is well designed i cannot over look nintendo s greed  the fact that there is only one island  per switch is disappointing  it would not be so bad if every player  after the first was not restricted  from doing in game story content  with out these story missions  the 2and player misses out on most diy recipes  and cannot contribute  to building  the town  seeing as this is nothe entire  point of the game its frustrating  that i bought this for my wife  and she cant enjoy the game because  of the limitations   this was very frustrating  and demotivating  to her and almost  made her not wanting to play   this shameless  attempt  by nintendo  nintendo to make families by multiple  consoles  is unacceptable   animal  crossing is supposed  to be about build and community   only the first layer has that ability  unless this is patch ed i would avoid this game unless you are a single person with out family  members  that will want to play a family game    i give this a 1  expand
1298,i love the look of this game and wish i were leaving a better review  unfortunately my partner started playing it first and since we share a switch i cannot create my own island  i was really hoping to have my own area to customize and my own story to progress through  love my boyfriend  not looking to do any more couples decorating than we already do not gonna give it a zero  becausei love the look of this game and wish i were leaving a better review  unfortunately my partner started playing it first and since we share a switch i cannot create my own island  i was really hoping to have my own area to customize and my own story to progress through  love my boyfriend  not looking to do any more couples decorating than we already do not gonna give it a zero  because that does not reflect the large amount of work that went into this game  but i certainly will not be that interested in  seeing what it has to offer until i can start fresh  expand
1299,due to the one island limit and that the first player is nothe only one who can advance the story  because of this it has made being a second player a second class villager  on top of that what was a storyline that you can do eventually a job as you are holding back your other players abilities  making being the first player a job not fun 
1300,should have disclosed multiplayer limitations broadly  having one player lead is bad  but not being upfront about it was the real issue  a few days in our primary player quit playing  i was stuck  i had to delete the island and start over in order to  fix it  there is no way to change primaries apart from starting over which is dumb  we moved all our stuff to another island  we alreadyshould have disclosed multiplayer limitations broadly  having one player lead is bad  but not being upfront about it was the real issue  a few days in our primary player quit playing  i was stuck  i had to delete the island and start over in order to  fix it  there is no way to change primaries apart from starting over which is dumb  we moved all our stuff to another island  we already had two copies  before blowing away 3 people s savegames  wish journalists would ding the game for this  again  it was a design choice just like the one island per switch  i wouldo not like it  expand
1301,so you cant create more than 1 island per switch  and me and many other buyers of this game have to share their switch with someone  this limitation is ridiculous  the switch has the power to do so  and the only reason i see nintendo doing this is noto increase the switch sales  this is just disgusting 
1302,acnh s one island per switch console local multiplayer is a total money grab 
1303,kind of sucks when you have to share islands with people on the same switch  it just causes problems between people and overall is a whole mess  the game is still solid but if you are not the island representative then there is really not much to do because you cannot progress through the story quest  not to mention  even if you buy the game cartridge you are still not able to make akind of sucks when you have to share islands with people on the same switch  it just causes problems between people and overall is a whole mess  the game is still solid but if you are not the island representative then there is really not much to do because you cannot progress through the story quest  not to mention  even if you buy the game cartridge you are still not able to make a different island with other profiles on the switch so it basically limits you to that one shared island  nintendo is wrong for this  expand
1304,nintendo  not everyone can just say  oh  i will just get another switch then  but this is a really good game still  if you are playing alone  strongly recommended  this score 1 is just because how greedy nintendo is  even if  it is for keeping the similar tradition like the old games  this  one island per console  decision is still very inconsiderate under many situations 
1305,i was very disappointed with this game  i love the animal crossing series  but i am not a fan of new horizons  the game itself is amazing  but i cannot play it  the fact that only the first resident can make changes and progress the island is infuriating  my little sister demanded to play first and now she has no idea what she s doing  and i cannot play the game i paid  60 for  unbelievable 
1306,i have been playing for a couple of days and while i honestly thought it was a 9  i soon realized my sister as player 2 was not really able to do anything fun in the game and that really sucked out all the enjoyment i had with the game  being able to have fun alone is no fun at all  i really hope nintendo fixes this as the one island per console policy is incredibly unnecessary 
1307,the game looks good too bad i cannot actually play it  only the first player logging in gets the full experience  as player 2 you are stuck behind player 1 progression and do not get to do as much as him a pity and a shame for nintendo really frustrated and disappointed 
1308,so let me start with saying that animal crossing new horizons is a great game  the gameplay loop is satisfying  the music is calming  the graphics are cute and the mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp  if you are the sole owner of a nintendo switch  do not share the console with others and are a fan of the genre then purchasing this game is almost a no brainer however there isso let me start with saying that animal crossing new horizons is a great game  the gameplay loop is satisfying  the music is calming  the graphics are cute and the mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp  if you are the sole owner of a nintendo switch  do not share the console with others and are a fan of the genre then purchasing this game is almost a no brainer however there is a major issue with this game and that lies within sharing the game with other profiles on one console  it is a massive shame that greed has taken hold of nintendo here and has resulted in some extremely anti consumer practices  honestly  i expected more from nintendo  basically the first profile on the switch to play this game has the full experience  which again  is great  then the following profiles that play have a watered down version of the game  it is almost as if nintendo are punishing those who do not own their own console  this practice is very old school and nintendo are obviously way behind in this area  this is almost ea standard of ant consumerism and they have bucked up their ideas in recent times  i seriously hope nintendo sort this issue out  mostly because their greed and anti consumerism is notarnishing and destroying the reputation of a very good game  for the reasons above i have to give this game a 0 10  such practices should not be happening these days and especially from a company that is so family focused  thanks for reading  expand
1309,no support for multiple users is completely unacceptable in 2020  i love nintendo but this really needs to stop 
1310,the one island thing is so bad for a family with  2 kids and a dad they will all have a alone island 
1311,i was looking forward to playing this game  but the inability for different users to have their own islands makes it iso i literally cannot play this game  my girlfriend started an island  and she wants to play her island her way  i want to play my own island  but i cannot  my only option  fun as it may be  is noto play on my girlfriend s island  unable to make decisions and unable to movei was looking forward to playing this game  but the inability for different users to have their own islands makes it iso i literally cannot play this game  my girlfriend started an island  and she wants to play her island her way  i want to play my own island  but i cannot  my only option  fun as it may be  is noto play on my girlfriend s island  unable to make decisions and unable to move around freely  the game is great  i just wish i could play it  i have no choice but to give it a 0 since i am not even allowed to play  nintendo  please reverse this decision and let me play your game  expand
1312,do not purchase if you intend to play with multiple players  only the first child can progress the game or basically do anything on the island  no way for multiple islands  kids in tears  what a mess  absolutely moronic decision by the designers to not allow more than one player per game  unfortunately bought from the nintendo online shop so cannot return the game  do not purchase  i wantdo not purchase if you intend to play with multiple players  only the first child can progress the game or basically do anything on the island  no way for multiple islands  kids in tears  what a mess  absolutely moronic decision by the designers to not allow more than one player per game  unfortunately bought from the nintendo online shop so cannot return the game  do not purchase  i want to throw the switch out the window  will sell the stupid thing once ps5 is released  expand
1313,i really wish i could give the game a 10 but the decisions made in order to make money from this game are so greedy  it is intentionally set up to make people buy multiple consoles per household i initially got over the one island per console aspect  however the fact that i cannot make any island decisions or lose out on diy recipes because i wouldid not play first is ridiculous  therei really wish i could give the game a 10 but the decisions made in order to make money from this game are so greedy  it is intentionally set up to make people buy multiple consoles per household i initially got over the one island per console aspect  however the fact that i cannot make any island decisions or lose out on diy recipes because i wouldid not play first is ridiculous  there ishould at least be an option to change the representative of the island  another issue is nothat the multiplayer aspect was heavily advertised but is really clunky and awkward  i was really excited for both of us to have friends on the island but you cannot cross local and online play  meaning only one person can play while a visitor is on your island  im just really disappointed because the game has the potential to be spectacular  and if you are a solo player with no other players in the household it is great  but rather than try to make the game as enjoyable as possible for everyone  they decided to make it less enjoyable for secondary players in the hopes people will buy multiple consoles  expand
1314,this game should be punished for ruining the multiplayer user experience in the name of increasing their console sales  this is not  and should not be acceptable to the current industry regardless of the quality of solo game  consoles that have such heavily integrated user accounts and such profound multiplayer capability should not restrict users usage to one save per console wake upthis game should be punished for ruining the multiplayer user experience in the name of increasing their console sales  this is not  and should not be acceptable to the current industry regardless of the quality of solo game  consoles that have such heavily integrated user accounts and such profound multiplayer capability should not restrict users usage to one save per console wake up consumers and set consumer boundaries  wake up nintendo and stop abusing the system for your sales  show us you actually do care and change this one save per console atrocity  expand
1315,1 island per console means that after splitting the game 50 50 with my girlfriend i feel like a player 2 being unable to do most things  this issue needs fixed 
1316,my sister bought this game not knowing that we could not have separate islands  this was a problem because i was the first one in my family to play the game  and i even got pretty far  the fact that i had progressed up to the construction of the museum ended up being a problem because as my sister found out she could not register new creatures with tom nook and so she was stuck using amy sister bought this game not knowing that we could not have separate islands  this was a problem because i was the first one in my family to play the game  and i even got pretty far  the fact that i had progressed up to the construction of the museum ended up being a problem because as my sister found out she could not register new creatures with tom nook and so she was stuck using a flimsy rod and net on half of the island  this mad my sister very upset seeing as she had just payed  90 to play this game and now she was stuck on 2  of it  after searching many websites i found that there was no way for her to get a new island or even tools so i amade the decision to delete the file i had spent hours on so that my sister could play  come on nintendo stop being petty and forcing people to buy a new switch just make it iso people can have multiple islands on your family console  expand
1317,after playing for a week  i realized i have more fun with new leaf  new horizons has bafflingly removed core features that were present in new leaf  and the pacing of progression feels artificially slowed down to hide the lack content  this is coming from an ac veteran who knows what s missing and also knows what a more fun pacing for this notype of game feels like  the customization isafter playing for a week  i realized i have more fun with new leaf  new horizons has bafflingly removed core features that were present in new leaf  and the pacing of progression feels artificially slowed down to hide the lack content  this is coming from an ac veteran who knows what s missing and also knows what a more fun pacing for this notype of game feels like  the customization is deeper and far more fleshed out  but this feels like it was at the expense of some gameplay features  while relaxing and charming  if you want the purest core ac experience  dig up a 3ds and get new leaf that would be my 7 star review  but here is the kicker   reviewers have not discussed this because they tend to not share their consoles with a family  as a single player i am having a good time with the game  but the inability to allow multiple users their own islands is moronic  greedy  and especially cruel to low income households as such i have put my score at 0 to help send a message to nintendo  be kind to families  especially during a time like this  while a worldwide pandemic threatens everyone s normal life  fix this  nintendo  and i ll adjust my score  expand
1318,me and my boyfriend got in this huge fight because we went out  bought the switch and new horizons  just to find out only one of us can play  truly play  it is so frustrating  the population are not idiots  we understand that this is a ploy to get us to buy more nintendo switches  you think that this will get you more revenue  no  in fact it will hurt your game because there will not be asme and my boyfriend got in this huge fight because we went out  bought the switch and new horizons  just to find out only one of us can play  truly play  it is so frustrating  the population are not idiots  we understand that this is a ploy to get us to buy more nintendo switches  you think that this will get you more revenue  no  in fact it will hurt your game because there will not be as much users playing at the same time  why does anyone want to share an island together  the beauty of the game is being able to create whatever you want and express yourself  also the fact that the game is in real run time absolutely kills it  are you kidding me you are going to make it only one island  expecting the players to share because up to 8 of them can live on the island  and incorporate the fact that it is a deserted island so there is going to be nothing there  a lack of resources already  honestly  made the decisions to change this  this is a family fun oriented game and what keeps it interesting is seeing the other peoples towns that s what created spark  nobody wants to play on the same town  there is a lack of quests lack of everything  your customers are even trying to get refunded their money because of this  it is absolutely disgusting updatewe tried playing the co op on screen that they had an it was an absolute failure  they made one of us each be follower and leader  the follower could not access inventory  or go to nooks   buy stuff it was just the tools  seriously nintendo  the follower couldnt even talk to the residents either  such a disappointment  expand
1319,i was so excited to get this game for me and my kids  we all have enjoyed the ac games for years now  imagine my and my youngest child s disappointment when we arealized that the game my oldest created was now the only iteration of the game we can play on the early nintendo games packed tons of story and gameplay on tiny cartridges  but now with gigabytes of data available nintendo madei was so excited to get this game for me and my kids  we all have enjoyed the ac games for years now  imagine my and my youngest child s disappointment when we arealized that the game my oldest created was now the only iteration of the game we can play on the early nintendo games packed tons of story and gameplay on tiny cartridges  but now with gigabytes of data available nintendo made the decision to lock an entire console to one saved game  if they do not update the game to allow multiple saves an easy fix with today s technology i ll stop buying from them  the used cartridge market is alive and well if we areally want a switch game  besides  there are tons of indie computer games available  i am tired of supporting greedy gaming giants  expand
1320,the fact i need a new switch so my gf and i can have seperate accounts is heart breaking  i cannot afford a new switch  i would be fine if we both shared an island but had the same controls  but p2 cannot do anything that makes the game worth playing  love the game  but we need a fix please

1322,one island per switch  i wanted to play the game with my girlfriend  but as the second player she does not have the same rights i wouldo  which is just a poor decision by nintendo
1323,pretty upset that my wife played first so now i cannot even have my own island to play on and work on myself  i can only go and help out hers now  such an old and upsetting way to handle game saves  nintendo  let us see if you wouldo the right thing and fix it
1324,pretty underwhelming to be honest  i would not recommend it if you wouldo not plant to play it with friends or if you are new to the game and if that s the case i recommend that you play any of the other previous games and if you like it then wait isome months and then buy it  because this game isn t worth 60 bucks 
1325,good game but the one island per console is a joke  was really looking forward to sharing this game but can no longer do it as there is the one island  the second person has no power to do anything as well which does not make sense either 
1326,what a joke  what an absolute joke this is nintendo  let other users have their own island you greedy mongrels  i will not let this end  i will not let you guys get away with this 
1327,i think the game actually seems to be a good game as far as animal crossing goes  however  with a family in which many people want to play it does not work for us  yes you can share 1 island  but that s very difficult for children and while i would be willing to buy multiple copies of the game to have multiple islands it is ridiculous to limit it to 1 per console in modern times and on ai think the game actually seems to be a good game as far as animal crossing goes  however  with a family in which many people want to play it does not work for us  yes you can share 1 island  but that s very difficult for children and while i would be willing to buy multiple copies of the game to have multiple islands it is ridiculous to limit it to 1 per console in modern times and on a game in which no competitive benefit is gained its silly for ac to have become more and not less restricted  expand
1328,ninteno is 20 years behind in gameplay  1 island per switch  no save transfer  even in local co op only 1 person can help to make anything  i think they are just trying to force people to buy more copies and buy more switches  unrelated  they unfairly copyright claim videos to make them unwatchable 
1329,it is hard to give this game a lukewarm score  but that is what ended up happening with this game from a gameplay standpoint  it is very surely animal crossing  it includes most of the features from past games  some which were lost including some bugs and fish  this is all nice  it is as expected the good better graphics with dynamic lighting based on weather customization ofit is hard to give this game a lukewarm score  but that is what ended up happening with this game from a gameplay standpoint  it is very surely animal crossing  it includes most of the features from past games  some which were lost including some bugs and fish  this is all nice  it is as expected the good better graphics with dynamic lighting based on weather customization of your island allows for making the exact town you want putting furniture outside for the first time nook miles gives daily and long term motivation to do many varied things in the game and allow for faster progress and reduce boredom you now progress more than just your house and the store  which gives a better sense of growth museum is way more pretty custom items are an amazing addition  custom hats  shirts  pants  skirts  face art think adding facial hair    and even ground tiles can be added the bad made multiplayer very poorly multiple people in the same town cannot help add to growing the town  and can get soft locked by recipes that are not given to them island tied to your console  not the game save on the cart or even your nintendo account profile you cannot transfer you island save data  to another console nintendo refuses to provide cloud saves for no good reason claiming to prevent cheating and manipulation  even though time travel is still possible and used heavily not enough new content  the game needed a new villager type or two  needed way more new bugs  fish and fossils to keep me trawling the waters and carefully treading between trees  at that  different tree types would have been nice too crafting only 1 item at a time  it gets tedious and annoying to craft tons of items in a sitting  no idea why i cannot craft 20 fish bait at once instead of one at a time  watching the animations over and over  that isn t gameplay  that isn t fun  that isn t relaxing would have liked to see other static town npcs make a return  especially bather s kin with the observatory and the cafe  the police dogs are also sorely missed this had the chance to be the quintessential animal crossing  but it failed on all fronts and just became another iteration  a fun one  but nothing special  it isn t a smash ultimate  but if you want a relaxing game or just a return to the series  it is adequate  just do not expect to enjoy any multiplayer  this is a very single player game  and be sure you have the switch console you want to have forever  do not settle for a console you wouldo not want  because upgrading either means a new console  or losing all your game progress  expand
1330,the game is amazing and beautiful but just like a lot of others i am done with this greedy mother  s 1 island per switch yea f  you nintendo
1331,the obvious very big thorn here is nothe very poor application of limiting more than one player on one switch from playing the full game  i bought this for my wife and i to play and as the second player  i cannot advance the game and am limited to minute tasks that make no difference toward game progress  nintendo really kicked themselves here  i have always had very high confidence andthe obvious very big thorn here is nothe very poor application of limiting more than one player on one switch from playing the full game  i bought this for my wife and i to play and as the second player  i cannot advance the game and am limited to minute tasks that make no difference toward game progress  nintendo really kicked themselves here  i have always had very high confidence and trust in nintendo until this point  if this is nothe stuff they re going to pull  i will be very very hesitant on purchasing any future titles  which is sad  this could be a great game  but for a family wanting to play  the limitations bombed this score for me  what a disappointment  expand
1332,love the atmosphere and game play  but i am horribly disappointed that i cannot back up or transfer my data to a different switch  what if the switch gets broken  what if it is being used by a different family member  this makes no sense at all  please change this policy  if it was implemented to cut down on time cheaters  you already failed at that one 
1333,i have never before had my children fight and cry over a blasted video game   incredibly poor design with no consideration for multiple players instances 
1334,each person in our family needs their own island  what a let down  we would happily buy an additional game  but a needing a second console is ridiculous 
1335,the multiplayer limitation is absolutely unacceptable without clear warning 
1336,the fact that there can only be one island per switch  i let my little sister play the game before me cause she was excited and when i began to play i was not able to progress the game  it is unacceptable 
1337,only one person on a switch can experience what the game has to offer  what cruddy industry has to stoop this low for money  they screwed themselves with this
1338,honestly this game got ruined for me  today is my sister and i s birthday  so naturally i let her play the game first since that was her present  none of the promotional material out there warned me about the extreme limitations any player that isn t the first player to make the island has  it is honestly so frustrating that we spent 60  on a game that i cannot even play to the fullesthonestly this game got ruined for me  today is my sister and i s birthday  so naturally i let her play the game first since that was her present  none of the promotional material out there warned me about the extreme limitations any player that isn t the first player to make the island has  it is honestly so frustrating that we spent 60  on a game that i cannot even play to the fullest unless i purchase a new switch console another thing that just absolutely frustrates me is nothat there is only one island per switch  making it impossible for me to enjoy the game just as fully as my sister  i am honestly considering never touching the game again due to these really trivial and frustrating game design choices  nintendo should patch the game to make it better if they do not want their sales to plummet immensely in the next week  expand
1339,i wanted to like this game so much  but it has severe issues  enough to make it unplayable  to make a full review of the issues without spoiling even a thing   well  here is nothe first issue  you can only have one save game  one save slot  one island  in the entire console  you are forced to share the island with the other users  playing in your console  you change something in there  amdi wanted to like this game so much  but it has severe issues  enough to make it unplayable  to make a full review of the issues without spoiling even a thing   well  here is nothe first issue  you can only have one save game  one save slot  one island  in the entire console  you are forced to share the island with the other users  playing in your console  you change something in there  amd it will change for everyone on that console as well   a bit crappy  because there is a lot of people that preffer to put dedication or enjoy to play alone or just preffer to not have their kids messing with the island and the things youve done but it can be tolerable  except its not  because the game implements a system where the first player or user that plays the game  is a leader that consists of granting progression lock to all other users  what do i amean  it means that if the leader player hasnt played trough some part of the game  no one else can    it hears like a joke  like  havent you thought the leader player could just abando nothe game and force everyone to get stuck  or just not play as often and delay the hell out of the other users  this game seems promising  but so many stuff limit you for no reason whatsover really  who thought it would be neccesary to force everyone to share one single save game  and at the same time lock the progress to all users except the one who first booted up the game  yeah  because its not the user who bought the game but the one who plays it first  and yes  you guessed it  there is no way to change this leader player unless you wouldelete all save game data and let the game as new and unplayed  too many issues to be enjoyed just by a fatal saving system that nobody likes or understands why it was made that way  expand
1340,you can only have 1 island  i repeat  1 island per console  got a wife or husband that wants their own save file like every other game in existence  nope  got kids  you better shell out for another whole console  gameplay is irrelevant in light of these oversights  getting my  60 back 
1341,i have 2 kids  both want to play this game so badly  but both cannot play unless i buy another switch and another game copy  my girls were very excited when i got this for them  now they re sad and both offering to let the other  be player one  because only one player per switch per game copy can actually play  the other one pretty much has to sit around and pick their nose  thanksi have 2 kids  both want to play this game so badly  but both cannot play unless i buy another switch and another game copy  my girls were very excited when i got this for them  now they re sad and both offering to let the other  be player one  because only one player per switch per game copy can actually play  the other one pretty much has to sit around and pick their nose  thanks nintendo  your stupid  pointless  greedy decision on a kids game has made my kids very sad  at a very bad time for them to be sad  i offered to get them doom eternal  which they can both play  that game rocks  but they just want to play their cute island game  which they cannot  for no reason  kids  eh  fix your stupid game  make kids happy  please  expand

1347,i bought this game and my husband unlocked pretty much everything already  now i wanna play but it only allows one island per person  even if i buy another copy of the game it would not let me have another save

1349,when my partner first told me about animal crossing  i was kind of excited  i am from a tropical region and  while i had not played it as a kid  i had played harvest moon  and the prospect of making my own cute farm island was a reassuring way to pass covid 19 quarantine  the reality was not cute  my boyfriend did not think i wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and strippedwhen my partner first told me about animal crossing  i was kind of excited  i am from a tropical region and  while i had not played it as a kid  i had played harvest moon  and the prospect of making my own cute farm island was a reassuring way to pass covid 19 quarantine  the reality was not cute  my boyfriend did not think i wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and stripped  it of all resources  i had no idea how acnh worked so i started a save file thinking i would either get my own island or have different resources generated for my file  or like anything a reasonable designer would think of  right instead of starting with a tutorial explaining what choices would be permanent and unchangable  i got a message that just told me to put my tent down  noticing all the trees were bare  i confusedly put my tent close to my bf s and tried to figure out what to do   after running around breaking my flimsy tools for two hours trying to get wood and stone that would not spawn  i looked up what was happening  not only was there no way to respawn resources other players had hoarded  accidentally or not  as the non  representative resident  i could not donate to the museum until it was complete and i could not build the store nor decide where it was placed  i also learned that expanding our houses was impossible if they were too close  which seems like vital clarifying information in a game aimed at children we tried playing for a few days but even though we were communicating it was not working out  we play video games very differently  i am impatient  my partner does not like to put much thought into games or rush  i found out that i could time surf but my partner does not want to do that since he is  apparently   an animal crossing purist  or rather he does not want the villagers to be  mad at him for cheating for those who are reading and saying  so what you are just not trying to cooperate  we areally are and acnh does not really provide anything to help with that  there is no shared inventory pool so multiple players can easily contribute to helping build up the town in order to send resources to other accounts on the same system you have to either mail them per item for 200 bells each  time consuming and not cheap x 12 items per day  not exactly helpful  so after two days i had switched to hitting nook miles achievements and using all my miles for nook tickets so i could actually like  get anywhere in the game without stripping the island of resources he needs to build the town  my partner was surprised i payed off my home loan before him  i told him i was using the nook tickets like a revolving door to rack up achievements and resources  he said he had not used a ticket yet and had just bought hair styles  he was embarrassed to tell me this   i realized i was making him feel bad about his playing style just by him having to watch how i play  i normal speed through games faster than he does but he never has to play the same file i wouldo until acnh  we had thought this would be a fun bonding activity while we were locked in but it wound up being stressful and anxiety inducing the feeling we had fostered around the game was not one of shared joy and reassurance  but unease and mutual resentment  i resented that i could not run the island and build the town and my boyfriend resented seeing the rushed way i was playing since it took the relaxing element of playing away from him  so yesterday  i emptied my inventory out on the ground and deleted my animal crossing file  we have pretty good communication and lots of other games i enjoy so while upset  i am know my acnh experience isn t as bad as it could be  i know if i was a kid  who are the  main group  this game was made for  who had to share this with a sibling while in quarantine i would be crying  even if we bought a second cartridge we can only have one island per switch system half the world is unemployed for at least a month  does nintendo really expect people to buy second and third switch systems to play one game fairly tldr  i rate this game 0 10 for worsening an already traumatic experience of being trapped in my house with no control over the world  and making my partner and i feel bad for just wanting to play a game differently  bad user experience design for no easy item sharing while demanding people share an island  this was frustrating as adults with good impulse control  i cannot imagine how infuriating it is for the target audience of children and teens  expand
1350,do not buy this game if you have multiple people in your household that want to play this game  i wouldont even care  and even expected there to be only one island  the only issue i see with a 1 island limitation is nothat it is notiny with no room to expand  the big issue is nothat nintendo gives one user per switch a completely different experience than anyone else who wants to play the game  ido not buy this game if you have multiple people in your household that want to play this game  i wouldont even care  and even expected there to be only one island  the only issue i see with a 1 island limitation is nothat it is notiny with no room to expand  the big issue is nothat nintendo gives one user per switch a completely different experience than anyone else who wants to play the game  i would say the new features and aesthetics are great   but they do not even matter when you have a game that is fundamentally broken at its very core  for example  i am the second player to start the game and decided to help player 1 with getting furniture for new houses  i  didnt get any diy recipes for the items needed  and when i went to check the boxes for what was needed to create houses  there was zero info  tom nook just told me to talk to player 1  what is wrong with the developers to make a decision to encourage collaboration  but  only allow 1 player to have the resources to contribute i love animal crosssing games and have played from gamecube to ds to wii  this game was clearly designed to push families to purchase multiple switch lites  and gives the middle finger for anyone that wants to fully experience a flagship game on their flagship console  there is even a great irony and an  f you   when  they actually give you a switch console furniture piece for  you starting  your life on the island congratulations nintendo  you have successfully ruined  a beloved title  i wont review bomb and rate this at zero because everything else seems like it is good for player 1  otherwise  i will think twice about buying a game with nintendo s seal of approval  expand

1352,looks cool  my husband has a great time playing  but unfortunately  they only allow 1 island save per switch  so i will never know what it is like to play how i want to  got super excited to start and was dropped on to his already populated island  a real let down  shame in you nintendo  you know this is a greedy tactic 
1353,this game is marketed as being multiplayer friendly  and an experience all can enjoy and share together  it is not designed as such  unless you are a single person  or are the only person playing on the nintendo switch you wouldownload install this game on  this game is currently in a criminally unplayable state  currently  whichever switch user account launches animal crossing first  is nothethis game is marketed as being multiplayer friendly  and an experience all can enjoy and share together  it is not designed as such  unless you are a single person  or are the only person playing on the nintendo switch you wouldownload install this game on  this game is currently in a criminally unplayable state  currently  whichever switch user account launches animal crossing first  is nothe only account that gets the full retail game experience  all subsequent accounts have to play a miserable shadow of the game the customer paid for this design oversight is so heinous  it is causing many people  including myself  to wonder if this is actually a ploy by nintendo to get people to buy more switch switch lite consoles  as a life long fan of the company it would be pretty devastating to watch them go the way of ea  zenimax  and so many other fallen titans in the industry extended review the whole world is on lockdown right now  and a fun  relaxing  life sim type game such as this sounded like a great way for my wife and i to enjoy some decompression time together  not the case  i spent  60 dollars on the nintendo store only to find that we had to share one island  not a problem  but that only one of the profiles on the switch was able to progress the story  and advance our island s progress my wife was the first to launch the game  i amade my character and started building my only little house on the island a few hours after she had some time with the game  fast forward 3 days  and now i find that i cannot help settle new villagers  i cannot be given tasks by varying npcs  i cannot contribute have a say to the layout of new buildings and terraforming on the island  and a result  i have paid  60 for the pleasure of farming materials to trade to my wife s account for use as she deems fit this is a wholly unacceptable state of the game and legitimately needs to be patched  i will be following up with my credit card provider tethered to my nintendo online account  bought the game on switch store  and asking for refunds on the same basis nothat hundreds of thousands of fallout 76 players got their refunds for  consumer ethics breach nowhere in any advertising or marketing material was i given the impression that only one person in my household would be able to fully play the game  i am not talking about a subjective enjoyment of the game i am referencing the clear and simple fact that only one account per switch has access to the entirety of the game that was sold for  60 usd  secondary  tertiary  and all subsequent accounts will have a miserable  gated experience and have 0 agency over the only island the entirety of the household is allotted without a clear disclaimer being present prior to purchase  this is unethical and either needs to be patched or customers need to be refunded  until either happens  this is a 0 10  awful  regrettable purchase for anyone not living playing alone on their switch  expand
1354,it is such a shame that you wouldo not get an island per account  i amean  we get along fine  and our first reaction was that it was a shame not to be able to fill each our museum  or to just fully control our characters when we both play at the same time not having two islands unless you buy two consoles is greedy and is a big let down 
1355,if you want to share your new game with someone else in your household you have to buy another switch  and this particular moment due to horrible pandemic we are all going through a new switch can set you back upwards of  500 
1356,horrible decisions for multiple players  i bought this game because it is the only thing my wife will play  i let her play first and now  as soon as she gets bored of it  the game will stop progressing   i cannot restart the island because i want her to have the player 1 experience in the only game she has ever shown interest in   this would be fine for a 20 30 dollar title  but for a fullhorrible decisions for multiple players  i bought this game because it is the only thing my wife will play  i let her play first and now  as soon as she gets bored of it  the game will stop progressing   i cannot restart the island because i want her to have the player 1 experience in the only game she has ever shown interest in   this would be fine for a 20 30 dollar title  but for a full 60 it is unacceptable it completely overshadows any charm this game has   and all the people saying its fine are people that are not affected by the issue  i feel as if i was sold an experience tthat was not advertised as what it really is   it is a single player game   players 2 8 might as welll be npcs   nintendo laid an egg   but it could definitely be fixed   but i would not count on it  expand
1357,fantastic game  daily grind is super addicting and the game is as charming as can be  love this game
1358,i am not sure if this is pure nintendo style incompetence or unethical  malicious  money hungry nastiness   i prefer the latter because i cannot imagine nintendo is nothis inept  here are the main issues which this otherwise great game which drag it down to the depths of cynical  corporate garbage 1   one island per switch   what   completely and utterly destroys any hopes of playing withi am not sure if this is pure nintendo style incompetence or unethical  malicious  money hungry nastiness   i prefer the latter because i cannot imagine nintendo is nothis inept  here are the main issues which this otherwise great game which drag it down to the depths of cynical  corporate garbage 1   one island per switch   what   completely and utterly destroys any hopes of playing with others   if you are in a household with multiple people who want to play this game  think twice before buying   this will create problems and essentially force you to both buy a second switch  or more  if you want to have the experience   what are parents supposed to do with multiple kids who want to play   nintendo s plan all along was to have multiple switches per household  and they are trying to implement it in the most disgusting way  with artificially installed limitations   there is no technical limitation there cannot be more than than one island per switch 2   is nothere a way around it through coop   no   local coop is bare bones  pathetic  and an embarassment   you have zero agency as the second partner  basically just following along like an idiot   you cannot progress in any meaningful way   so no  this is not an option for multiple people to enjoy this game 3   online multiplayer   do not get me started   i have never seen such a poorly implemented online from nintendo   this is worse than smash   and that s saying a lot   firstly  you have to go to the airport  wade through seas of text  including the bird actually connecting to the internet   is nothis dial up   then when you finally get to of a friend s island  and someone else wants to join  you will have to sit through a green message popping up forcing you to quit your menu  a five stage flight screen for the plane to arrive  god knows why this is necessary  what is it loading  a save screen  and a cutscene of the person walking in the airport   this happens every time someone joints the island  and breaks up anything you are doing multiple times   absolute lunacy   again  not sure if this is incompetence or purposeful   nintendo is known to hate online   this is notheir way of saying   online is unplayable  do not do it  just buy more switches and play locally   also  why are there no mini games to play with friends like new leaf   there is nothing to do with multiplayer online and things get boring fast   would minigames have been so difficult to implement 4  no cloud saves at launch   apparently something is being worked on   why not at launch   is it iso hard   are they so concerned about cheating   people are time travelling like crazy as we speak   they could have easily imposed some limitation like one cloud save per day   this is just mean  honestly   pure meanness   creates unnecessary added stress about losing your save   apparently a download will be allowed once  but who knows if this is notrue   why these are just some of many issues   what is nintendo thinking   they have been working on this since 2012 do not expect a patch   like mario part  smash  etc  there has never been a patch that improves the fundamental problems of the game single player is good but i have to give 0 10 for this because it cannot be comprehended other than through a lens of cynical exploitation  expand
1359,the game itself is ok  it is good animal crossing experience  but it is a game entire family wants to play and with save limitation nobody can play it because if one plays it he she is showing middle finger to all the other family members  game leads to fights between kids and disappointment among gamer adults  i am so down right now 
1360,well done nintendo on such a greedy money grabbing technique to force people to buy multiple devices copies of the game in order to play within the same family  with current events  do you think people are made of money  unbelievable 
1361,well   now i have to spend extra  400  to not ruin my little sister progress  oh wait i lost my job  nice 
1362,my 11 year old daughter was the first to play   little did i realize that she would therefore be the owner of the island   she got to name it and no one can change anything about it   nor can anyone else in the household have the same gameplay experience because you can only have one island per switch console   i am was really looking forward to playing   now i am disappointed and upset thatmy 11 year old daughter was the first to play   little did i realize that she would therefore be the owner of the island   she got to name it and no one can change anything about it   nor can anyone else in the household have the same gameplay experience because you can only have one island per switch console   i am was really looking forward to playing   now i am disappointed and upset that i wasted the money buying this game  expand
1363,ign s review animal crossing is a social simulation video game multiplayer  there is not much to do  than get in each others way ign verdict  9   what the actually   someone should be fired from his job never trust critiques   they all lie   first warcraft 3 reforged  now this  
1364,i cannot believe nintendo has people spending  60 on this game and not giving it more than 1 save file  people use this as a home console and many families will be restricted because of the save files as well as the fact that player 1 gets to choose everything 
1365,i will give the game a good note when nintendo decides to let me play  as i am the second player and my sister left the game i literally cannot play the game if i wouldo not waste like 20 hours of gameplay  this game sucks and will not stop sucking unless nintendo patches the game and let you change the resident representative
1366,the one island per console has caused me to hate the game  i have no control over my girlfriend s island  what she says goes and i rarely to never get to pick villagers because she wants the perfect island  it has ruined my fun and i wouldo not even want to play the damn game now  it is not review bombing if this is literally the way i feel   but they said it was one island in an article  goodthe one island per console has caused me to hate the game  i have no control over my girlfriend s island  what she says goes and i rarely to never get to pick villagers because she wants the perfect island  it has ruined my fun and i wouldo not even want to play the damn game now  it is not review bombing if this is literally the way i feel   but they said it was one island in an article  good for them  i wouldo not read articles constantly  expand
1367,made this account just to say the nintendo overloads are greedy demons  forcing players to buy another  300 switch  just to share the game with loved ones is fking criminal  i highly advise not buying the game if you live with anyone else who s excited to play it 
1368,i actually think this game is really amazing  addictive and all that jazz  but i cannot get behind the  one island per switch  and every player past player 1 is useless and cannot do anything to help the island or have fun in general  it is just nintendo s way of making people pay for another game and switch  it is abysmal 
1369,a phenomenal game by nintendo  it looks amazing and is one of the most relaxing games on the market  everything you wouldo is just so enjoyable which is really sad because nintendo have seriously f ed up the multiplayer and save system  if you want the full animal crossing experience  you need to be the island representative  if you are not the island representative then tough luck  you area phenomenal game by nintendo  it looks amazing and is one of the most relaxing games on the market  everything you wouldo is just so enjoyable which is really sad because nintendo have seriously f ed up the multiplayer and save system  if you want the full animal crossing experience  you need to be the island representative  if you are not the island representative then tough luck  you are gonna get a pretty bad animal crossing experience since only the representative can progress the story and gain new features  it honestly sucks  also one island per switch is a concept which should be opt in or out and having one island per switch just makes the representative problem even worse this honestly just feels like nintendo being greedy  only one person per switch can have the full animal crossing experience and if you want to have it as well  buy another switch and if you want to play together  buy another copy of the game which is a massive investment and one made out of pure greed seriously  not a 0 out of 10 game but these issues are just too much and nintendo needs to hear this loud and clear  expand
1370,the main game is great  a classic animal crossing experience with tons of new features and a great setting  it really is a lovely game however  problems begin to surface when you want to play with another person  i purchased this game to make the corona quarantine easier for me and my gf  but as soon as her character arrived at the island  i arrived first  we found out she was nothingthe main game is great  a classic animal crossing experience with tons of new features and a great setting  it really is a lovely game however  problems begin to surface when you want to play with another person  i purchased this game to make the corona quarantine easier for me and my gf  but as soon as her character arrived at the island  i arrived first  we found out she was nothing more than a  secondary  citizen she could not get new diy recipes  participate in new projects  put things in the museum or even help with existing projects  her progress was limited by mine  and since i wouldo not play as much as her  she basically got a watered down version of the game this is obviously a conscious design decision on nintendo s part to encourage players to purchase more switch consoles  since you cannot have more than one island on the same one  this creates a terrible experience for anyone who is not the first player   i can only imagine how much this would suck for a whole house of people who want to play together this is similar in vein to how the online features are locked only to players with an online subscription  if they are not present   other local players cannot play online  so the only way to work around this is noto create the online subscriber s character in local multiplayer using another controller  and then just have them stand around  allowing other players to use online features  again  a stupid  greedy design decision by nintendo  expand
1371,it is a fantastic game  just fun to play  nice and relaxing   the island is a bit ismall but it does not change the overall fun of the game  people have been giveing this game a 0 just beacuse it only gives you one island per switch and while that could be a minor annoyance it does not take away from the fun of this game at all

1373,can only have access to one island per console  no good to me or my misses as we cannot play individual games  sold it  lost  10  may rebuy the game if they update it but it is not looking likely  utter  
1374,i cannot believe this game will only allow 1 island per switch  not even 1 island per game card  which even then is ridiculous  i want to play this so badly but to do so i need to buy a whole other switch  despite not agreeing with even needing another game card at least it would mean i can still enjoy this game and i would have totally done so  this greed by nintendo is very disappointingi cannot believe this game will only allow 1 island per switch  not even 1 island per game card  which even then is ridiculous  i want to play this so badly but to do so i need to buy a whole other switch  despite not agreeing with even needing another game card at least it would mean i can still enjoy this game and i would have totally done so  this greed by nintendo is very disappointing to see as i have always been such a big fan of them  the entire premise of the console is noto be for family and sharing yet they pull a stunt like this  very disappointing nintendo i hope they fix this soon  expand
1375,not being able to have multiple islands is a joke and giving one person all the control is worse  for my family to enjoy it besides just one of us i would have to buy another switch  what a joke nintendo needs to fix this
1376,even though the game itself is great and as gorgeous and fun as any of its predecessors  i cannot think of any reason why nintendo could have thought that ruining the experience of any other player except the 1st one was a great idea  i would love to give it a much higher score but the fact that the 2nd player becomes so dependable of the 1st one and misses out so much makes this animaleven though the game itself is great and as gorgeous and fun as any of its predecessors  i cannot think of any reason why nintendo could have thought that ruining the experience of any other player except the 1st one was a great idea  i would love to give it a much higher score but the fact that the 2nd player becomes so dependable of the 1st one and misses out so much makes this animal crossing worth much less  expand

1378,really the only score being so far behind in game play  one island not good enough 
1379,it is extremely disappointing that essentially only one user is able to enjoy the full game  why in the world am i  2nd user  not able to create my own island in any way  i would pay for my own nintendo online account if it would let me  but instead i get to essentially just be support to my wife s island  it is a shame that nintendo is doing this because i will never buy a nintendo productit is extremely disappointing that essentially only one user is able to enjoy the full game  why in the world am i  2nd user  not able to create my own island in any way  i would pay for my own nintendo online account if it would let me  but instead i get to essentially just be support to my wife s island  it is a shame that nintendo is doing this because i will never buy a nintendo product again  expand
1380,it is a good game  but the first player getting to do all the fun stuff makes it unplayable for my wife and me  nintendo please fix your game  
1381,after hearing that you can only have one island per console  as well as the co op experience being completely neutered  i will not be picking up the game unless it ever gets fixed 
1382,must play  this game is fun and addicting  a game that i can enjoy during quarantine 
1383,the game itself is very relaxing and fun to play  and has load of customization  if you plan to play solo  i highly recommend it my complaints arise when it comes to multiple people playing  i think that the decision to have one island per console  to build the community with those you play with would be understandable  if other players had the same influence as the main player the game itself is very relaxing and fun to play  and has load of customization  if you plan to play solo  i highly recommend it my complaints arise when it comes to multiple people playing  i think that the decision to have one island per console  to build the community with those you play with would be understandable  if other players had the same influence as the main player it is understandable to not want certain people to be able to modify the island  but it isn t an option to choose  extra players past the first are automatically restricted in what they can do  it iseems like it ishould be simple to give the main player the choice of allowing others the same management privileges as they have in addition  recipes obtained through the storyline have no reason to not be mailed to the other players  it is silly and needs to be changed  crafting is shown as a big focus  and losing a lot of customization options for absolutely no good reason is ridiculous  expand

1388,i am sure this is a great game for my daughter  who is nothe resident representative  she was the most excited  so we let her play first  i spent several hours trying to figure out what the point of the game was  only to discover that since i am not the resident  there is not a point  did not realize in buying this game for our family that only one of us would have a real game experience  veryi am sure this is a great game for my daughter  who is nothe resident representative  she was the most excited  so we let her play first  i spent several hours trying to figure out what the point of the game was  only to discover that since i am not the resident  there is not a point  did not realize in buying this game for our family that only one of us would have a real game experience  very disappointed  expand
1389,if you want another save file you have to purchase a 300  switch again  if sony or microsoft did this nothey would be finished  animal crossing is not a 10 10 but it is a 0 when there are no save files for a game that had 5 years of development wow
1390,i cannot even play it  the person i share a switch with wants to have their own island  so i am unable to play the game at all because of a bad design decision by nintendo that was not at all necessary  they offered to buy the game because i wouldo not have much of a disposable income right now  neither of us knew about the limitation of 1 island per switch before they purchased the game  sincei cannot even play it  the person i share a switch with wants to have their own island  so i am unable to play the game at all because of a bad design decision by nintendo that was not at all necessary  they offered to buy the game because i wouldo not have much of a disposable income right now  neither of us knew about the limitation of 1 island per switch before they purchased the game  since they bought it  i am obviously not arguing with them about it  but it blows  i have been looking forward to the game for over a year and now it will probably be at least another year until i can play it  expand
1391,i was happy with everything except the save game system it was made so that unscrupulous players would not duplicate things  but ordinary players who just play can suffer  in the event of a crash or breakage of the console  the saves can disappear without a trace and no one will restore them and in a game like this  the number of game hours can count tychyachi and in this case it will bei was happy with everything except the save game system it was made so that unscrupulous players would not duplicate things  but ordinary players who just play can suffer  in the event of a crash or breakage of the console  the saves can disappear without a trace and no one will restore them and in a game like this  the number of game hours can count tychyachi and in this case it will be extremely disappointing to lose everything  expand
1392,i have never played animal crossing before  sooo my bad  i should have researched the game first  did not think i had to  ya know  so yeah  i spent hours figuring out why i cannot do   this led me to look online to find some tutorials or tips  but learned that the first person to play the game is nothe only one to make major decisions or progress the game  i was the second player i have never played animal crossing before  sooo my bad  i should have researched the game first  did not think i had to  ya know  so yeah  i spent hours figuring out why i cannot do   this led me to look online to find some tutorials or tips  but learned that the first person to play the game is nothe only one to make major decisions or progress the game  i was the second player  obviously  seriously  that s utterly garbage  i have never been so disappointed in a game before that i would make an account on metacritic just to post this review  again  my bad  i should have looked into the game and read the reviews first before wasting my money it is a cute game and the one island primary player might work for some couples families  but if you are completely new to animal crossing then know what you are getting into before buying  expand
1393,as someone who bought this game expecting to share it with the family  i am disappointed that everyone besides the first player gets to make the essential decisions for the island  there was not even a warning about this  clearly this is a greedy ploy from nintendo to get more people to buy their own consoles 
1394,i cannot stop playing the game which is nothe most unfortunate part about it  i purchased the game and immediately fell in love  so much so that i spent the absurd amount of money on the new horizons switch only to find out that i cannot transfer my game data to my new console  now i am left with a brand new switch collecting dust in the closet until nintendo decides to get it together andi cannot stop playing the game which is nothe most unfortunate part about it  i purchased the game and immediately fell in love  so much so that i spent the absurd amount of money on the new horizons switch only to find out that i cannot transfer my game data to my new console  now i am left with a brand new switch collecting dust in the closet until nintendo decides to get it together and allow save data transfers  expand
1395,as a long time animal crossing fan  going all the way back to the gamecube game  i have been having a lot of fun with this game  there are a lot of quality of life changes and the customization is amazing  the best it is ever been but my opinion with this game would be drastically different if i had someone to share the game with  and i cannot overlook this fault even if i wouldo not have toas a long time animal crossing fan  going all the way back to the gamecube game  i have been having a lot of fun with this game  there are a lot of quality of life changes and the customization is amazing  the best it is ever been but my opinion with this game would be drastically different if i had someone to share the game with  and i cannot overlook this fault even if i wouldo not have to deal with it  forcing each player to be a part of the first players town and then giving said players less abilities than the first is nothing but downright atrocious  this is made even worse when the very first entry did not have this issue  allowing players to make towns based on the memory card used  why was this drastic change made to the latest console animal crossing when there was no issue to begin with  is nintendo really that afraid that some people might try to cheat their completely cooperative  80 game  who cares  fix this issue  and i would easily give this game an 8 or 9  expand
1396,this game is extremely limited if you are not the 1st person to make a character on your switch  whatever you wouldo  be sure you are the first person or else you might as well not even play the game  i hope nintendo decides to update the game to fix this issue by at least allowing players to switch who is nothe resident representative for an already existing island 
1397,this game is amazing  one of the best this year but nintendo needs to stop with the bs and give us cloud saves  multiple islands on 1 switch for users  and the ability to transfer data to another switch in general not just with cloud saves 
1398,i cannot believe the hype of this game  i have never been so bored of repetitive stone hitting  tree chopping  fishing and bug catching  also the fact you can only have one island is beyond a joke  nintendo should be ashamed to release this at full price  you should also not need nintendo online to visit friends islands  this game was made for social interaction  something it tries it isi cannot believe the hype of this game  i have never been so bored of repetitive stone hitting  tree chopping  fishing and bug catching  also the fact you can only have one island is beyond a joke  nintendo should be ashamed to release this at full price  you should also not need nintendo online to visit friends islands  this game was made for social interaction  something it tries it is hardest to steer you away from  one other thing is nothe washed up character on the shores who keeps coming back and making you collect his communicator parts  i have had to do this 7 times in a week  why on earth could they not think of any other tasks  everything is mundane and dull and i would seriously avoid  no idea how this got a 91  what a joke  expand
1399,oneislandsux    really  you have to be kidding   to not give the option is down right trashy  so glad the game experience is notrash because i had to go to work and now do not get to play the game as intended   greed   greedy  trashy  greedsters 
1400,as others have stated  i amade an account just to give this game a bad review  it is notranquil and cute and seemingly fun  but for a game focused on multiplayer and community  seemingly  there is a starting lack of functionality 
1401,i hate this game for the local and online that you can play with 8 people together but they cannot do anything  do not buy this for family members and think you can play together
1402,horrible game  wanted to try because of all the hype but it is the most boring game i have ever had the displeasure of playing  i have no idea why this game is getting so much praise  gave it an honest go and paid full price but i guess it is just not for me  if you wouldo not mind super slow games then you will probably be able to get into it 
1403,animal crossing has always been a charming  simple game designed to be a relaxing sandbox  new horizons definitely checks all those boxes  even if it does very little to actually improve on the game s age old formula one thing i see as a big step back  or at least a completely stagnant characteristic on par with harvest moon s stubborn refusal to include same gender relationships whileanimal crossing has always been a charming  simple game designed to be a relaxing sandbox  new horizons definitely checks all those boxes  even if it does very little to actually improve on the game s age old formula one thing i see as a big step back  or at least a completely stagnant characteristic on par with harvest moon s stubborn refusal to include same gender relationships while indie games like stardew valley do it iso well  is nothe island sharing mechanic  i see a lot of people complaining that anyone who complains about this just wants to be  boosted  to stop whining and enjoy the game  the only logical reasoning is nothat those people are so entitled that they cannot imagine the game was not made for their sole enjoyment or so socially challenged that they cannot fathom how a family might want to share a console while still having a full gameplay experience for all players while i will not rant on and on about how this is completely unacceptable  it does show that the developers either cannot design a game that allows for separate and independent save files  a worrying prospect  or did not imagine that some people might like having their own  separate sandbox experience without either having to limit their own or other people s experience in order to do so  after multiple installments of a very family friendly game  families usually have more than one people in them  and many will have more than one member interested in the game  which is brings me to believe that while animal crossing will always be able to deliver in charm  it will never grow to be better than what it is and will always be this might be the last animal crossing game i will purchase  unless i see some effort on their part on actually creating an evolving experience with each game tl dr  good and fun  buy if you have your own console  skip it if you have to share with someone else  expand

1407,game feels too linear for ac and just unfinished  the crafting mechanic feels added just to slow progress    daughter cant do anything without my assistance because nook is closed for 2 days   feels like a mobile game youd play 1 hr a day

1412,i have played the game for about 30 hours now and had a lot of fun  i see that a lot of people do not like the wait  but if you say that then why did you buy the game  and there is always the option of time travelling  i had a huge blast with the game so far and it came out at the perfect time for corona

1416,boo nintendo  yet again u do these anti consumer practices i wouldont like this at all 
1417,this game is locked behind the first person who plays the game and so others who start have to wait for that person for progression throughout the island  this game would be so much better if nintendo let all players contribute equally to the games progression 
1418,obviously a cash grab from nintendo    anyone who played animal crossing before should not expect the same experience with this one island per switch and you have to pay to get more   what happened providing a game where everyone in the household can play they own game   seriously disappointed  skip

1442,this game is an excellent social simulator for all of you complaining about the single console multiplayer experience  i have some rhetorical questions below for the complaints about one villager making all the story driven decisions   if you play this game as a family  does everyone in the family make all the real life decisions or is it just the adults   does everyone pay for thethis game is an excellent social simulator for all of you complaining about the single console multiplayer experience  i have some rhetorical questions below for the complaints about one villager making all the story driven decisions   if you play this game as a family  does everyone in the family make all the real life decisions or is it just the adults   does everyone pay for the bills  mortgage  decide where the kids go to school   this game is a social simulator for those complaining that you have to wait for the main villager to progress so you can enjoy the island as the second player   do you not play together   do you all not enjoy real life together and usually make decisions together   if you are an adult with kids  does the adult make most of the decisions or do the kids   this game is a social simulator i understand the nintendo switch is very popular and there are many more new players to the animal crossing franchise   these complaints are mostly from new players to the series because previous installments of animal crossing are similar  i e  new leaf   if you played new leaf and have complained on this site  not sure what you were thinking  and i cannot help you in conclusion  if you want an adventure game where you share one console but have separate experiences  i recommend the legend of zelda  breath of the wild   because that s what you all are complaining about  animal crossing is not breath of the wild   all together now  this is a social simulator  expand
1443,this game is amazing and i am personally sick of this review bombing nonsense it is an incredible game and very relaxing for me personally i highly recommend you go out and buy it
1444,the people giving the game 0 are just wrong  its a fantastic game with 1 poor thing about it  the limitations but do not let that put you off 
1445,the game is absolutely lovely but the couch multiplayer is so poorly implemented it will lead to divorce  half the game  if you are playing it with another player half the game is waiting for them to do stuff  also  you have to walk back to the recycling bin all the time as even though the other villagers have their own inventory  it is so poorly implemented  they should have honestly keptthe game is absolutely lovely but the couch multiplayer is so poorly implemented it will lead to divorce  half the game  if you are playing it with another player half the game is waiting for them to do stuff  also  you have to walk back to the recycling bin all the time as even though the other villagers have their own inventory  it is so poorly implemented  they should have honestly kept it isingle player rather than shoehorning this dumpster fire of cooperation in  if you want a better co op game  try luigi s mansion  or get another switch to play this with a friend  expand

1447,do not listen to the salty review bombers the game is nice  it is relaxing and you can really get caught up in the collecting aspect of it  there are only two big issues for me 1  they still have not integrated an in game time travel system yet  despite the fact that you can only play about  30 minutes to an hour every day if you wouldo not time travel using the switch s system settings  thisdo not listen to the salty review bombers the game is nice  it is relaxing and you can really get caught up in the collecting aspect of it  there are only two big issues for me 1  they still have not integrated an in game time travel system yet  despite the fact that you can only play about  30 minutes to an hour every day if you wouldo not time travel using the switch s system settings  this is frustrating because the developers know very well that half  if not more  of the players playing the game will time travel anyway  so refusing to make it an in game mechanic seems like stubbornness  a lot of time is wasted when you have to save  close the game  go to system settings  change the time and re open the game every 30 minutes just to advance to the next day 2  as i had feared when the game was announced  the game sadly is not worth the  60 price tag  no matter how you split it  what it does do  it does perfectly  just like all the animal crossing games before it  but it just does not do enough to warrant the nearly doubled price compared to new leaf  there are apps on ios that legitimately have more content than this game  and this game cost me a whole day s wages  in short  if you are a die hard animal crossing fan  you will probably love this game  but then again  if you areally are  then you were going to love it regardless of what i said  if you have not played animal crossing before and are looking into it  i would advise against getting new horizons unless you are flush with cash  you will get the same experience by buying one of the earlier  cheaper animal crossings or a comparable game like stardew valley or harvest moon  expand
1448,as a fan who has played previous titles  new horizons seems to be a solid title but it is no greater than new leaf and city folk i honestly feel like the craft system does not work for this notype of a game considering the massive differences they presented here compared to the previous series  however  for those who own a switch and have never played an animal crossing  i wouldo recommendas a fan who has played previous titles  new horizons seems to be a solid title but it is no greater than new leaf and city folk i honestly feel like the craft system does not work for this notype of a game considering the massive differences they presented here compared to the previous series  however  for those who own a switch and have never played an animal crossing  i wouldo recommend buying it because it a great opportunity to get into the series  it is addictive overall just like previous titles  everything is so enjoyable from the activities you can engage with your friends who may also have the game  there is notoo much effort to be made in this animal crossing  from tools breaking as well as the nook miles system which i believe is not neccessary  i would also like to mention that another limitation i really despise the most is only have one island per console even though i am the one who mostly plays this game on my switch this game does encourage you to work your way up just like previous titles but more challenging  you are required to constantly craft tools if your previous ones break  overall  hopefully nintendo can address the issues in the future  the visuals are a massive improvement and the experience is quite neat  expand

1450,only one island per console  the only way to get another is noto buy another console i wouldo not mind buying another copy of the game but another console is notoo much  i am leaving such a negative score in the hopes nintendo has a change of heart 
1451,honestly made an account just so i can express my deep frustration of the one island per console debacle  me and my wife were both extraordinarily excited build our own islands  after she played for a couple days i wouldecided it was time and was extremely let down when i realized i could not have my own animal crossing experience  please for the love of all that is gaming fix this 
1452,it is a real shame that nintendo locked 1 island per switch  this is unacceptable and really disappointing  they cant even think of the fact that tons of people out there like having their own worlds their own way  horrible companies 
1453,games not bad  unfortunately i have been robbed of a genuine individual experience because my gf started first  1 island per switch is obnoxious 
1454,one of the biggest oversights  imho  is nothat you cant go to nook miles islands together  instead when i visit my wife s island i just mill about occasionally helping gather wood and water her plants  which just diminishes her ability to play her island  i wouldont even give gifts in person anymore since unlocking the postcards to friends feature so theres really no reason to visit meanwhileone of the biggest oversights  imho  is nothat you cant go to nook miles islands together  instead when i visit my wife s island i just mill about occasionally helping gather wood and water her plants  which just diminishes her ability to play her island  i wouldont even give gifts in person anymore since unlocking the postcards to friends feature so theres really no reason to visit meanwhile if we could all visit an island together  we could at least have fun in a little gathering instance  running around trying to find the best   cool stuff and meeting new villagers together  expand
1455,i understand the criticisms of the folks that scored this game low but the information concerning the  one island per switch  was announced and discussed almost a year prior to game s release i wouldo not disagree with it being a poor decision on nintendo s part and it would not surprise me if they did not do it as a marketing tool to promote switch sales but it was not a secret   thei understand the criticisms of the folks that scored this game low but the information concerning the  one island per switch  was announced and discussed almost a year prior to game s release i wouldo not disagree with it being a poor decision on nintendo s part and it would not surprise me if they did not do it as a marketing tool to promote switch sales but it was not a secret   the information was readily available on several sites prior to the game s release  expand
1456,a great game worth playing if you have the slightest interest that succeeds at everything it wants to do  but this isn t for everyone so you may not enjoy it if this notype of game isn t for you  my only complaint is nothe limiting of one island per switch which is really bad as it causes conflicting creative ideas and competing for resources  so if you share a switch with others who want toa great game worth playing if you have the slightest interest that succeeds at everything it wants to do  but this isn t for everyone so you may not enjoy it if this notype of game isn t for you  my only complaint is nothe limiting of one island per switch which is really bad as it causes conflicting creative ideas and competing for resources  so if you share a switch with others who want to play this game  then that s a big issue  and i cannot fully judge how big of a deal this is  expand
1457,it is undoubtedly the most stunningly beautiful game in the series  drawing you in from the first second you play and offering a perfect getaway during these trying times  everything feels a bit more polished and improved from the last entry  even though there are can be slightly frustrating inconsistencies  such as the tool belt not storing your tools while the dressing wand does store theit is undoubtedly the most stunningly beautiful game in the series  drawing you in from the first second you play and offering a perfect getaway during these trying times  everything feels a bit more polished and improved from the last entry  even though there are can be slightly frustrating inconsistencies  such as the tool belt not storing your tools while the dressing wand does store the clothes    but those are few and far between the atmosphere is simply soothing  causing you to linger and stay for longer than anticipated even if you just quickly want to get some chores done unfortunately  the way online   multiplayer features are handled feels lacking and old fashioned  but that s what we have come to expect from nintendo by now   always 10 years behind the latest tech  nevertheless  i personally feel that the island quickly becomes a very personal space that is best enjoyed alone  with only some irregular visits from others   so i wouldo not put much weight on the online features also addressing the critisisms being voiced in the review bombs at the moment the one island per console limit has been known for a long time ahead of this release and people acting surprized and entitled just did not do their research  also goes to show how playing together on one island is really not the main aspect of the game  making the bad multiplayer features i amentioned even less significant having to share one island per console is nothing new for the series  the 3ds had it too  it used to be more easily possible to bypass it as it technically possible to have one island per memory card   game cartridge  expand
1458,probably the best game of the year and the best switch title so far  the negative reviews are obviously jealous haters who cannot accept that the animal crossing franchise keeps giving high quality games and get even more successful  i can grant that i will be playing this game for a long time 
1459,this game oozes charm from the very first moments  you will enjoy relaxing on your very own deserted island  the game is honestly a 10 10
1460,appalling money grab from nintendo in that only one island can be made per switch  this means if you want to fully experience the game  you must buy another switch console  this is ridiculous and i have never played a game that does not allow for more than one save file on the same console  nintendo must fix this  as it is notransparent that this design choice was greed driven 
1461,the game is completely ruined for the second player  with the inability for multiple islands you would think nintendo would have made all players on the island equal  no  only the original character can actually participate in the majority of the game  only they can build things and upgrade shops and progress the game  all other characters are treated as second class citizens  this isthe game is completely ruined for the second player  with the inability for multiple islands you would think nintendo would have made all players on the island equal  no  only the original character can actually participate in the majority of the game  only they can build things and upgrade shops and progress the game  all other characters are treated as second class citizens  this is completely ridiculous  as someone who shares a switch  and has been waiting for this game for seven years  i am unable to play it because i cannot access what was advertised due to these arbitrary limitations that are outdated and unnecessary  expand

1463,the game is outstanding  nice calming gameplay and a very relaxing story but i just cannot progress because i am not the main player  i have a younger sister and she s the main player and can progress the story  i just cannot in general  i would love to make it a 9 but this is just a huge deal breaker to me 
1464,two players sharing a switch is a nightmare  only one island per switch is allowed  and on top of that  the second person to create their character has basically no autonomy in the game s quests and storyline some folks cannot afford a switch for everyone in the house  if the console has multiplayer capabilities  so should the game  nintendo knows how to do this  it is plain ol greed thatstwo players sharing a switch is a nightmare  only one island per switch is allowed  and on top of that  the second person to create their character has basically no autonomy in the game s quests and storyline some folks cannot afford a switch for everyone in the house  if the console has multiplayer capabilities  so should the game  nintendo knows how to do this  it is plain ol greed thats stopping them  expand
1465,my first animal crossing game and it has been an absolute blast to play this  great job nintendo  having one island is great and never would have wanted more 
1466,one island per console is a design decision that is  at best  in poor taste  and at worst  straight up predatory behavior per console  only one player gets to experience the game at its fullest  the other players see less dialogue  experience less events  and are locked out entirely from certain parts of the game no matter how good a game is  i cannot stand behind a company thatone island per console is a design decision that is  at best  in poor taste  and at worst  straight up predatory behavior per console  only one player gets to experience the game at its fullest  the other players see less dialogue  experience less events  and are locked out entirely from certain parts of the game no matter how good a game is  i cannot stand behind a company that sees fit to make such decisions  expand
1467,do not buy animal crossingespecially if you have more than 1 person that wants to play on the same switch each switch is allowed 1 save file not each profile each individual switch unit iso if you have a partner  or kids that are excited to start their own island and play  get ready to disappoint what a gigantic waste of money
1468,have to share an island with family members with progression determined by the first person who loads up the game   instant 0 10
1469,the worst game for families due to the priority of one player  the player who names the island is nothe main player and the others are so limited in their gameplay  trying to force people to buy another switch  limitations of second player include  not being able to complete a lot of the quests  not being able to buy or craft tools unless the first player has unlocked them beforethe worst game for families due to the priority of one player  the player who names the island is nothe main player and the others are so limited in their gameplay  trying to force people to buy another switch  limitations of second player include  not being able to complete a lot of the quests  not being able to buy or craft tools unless the first player has unlocked them before hand  not being able to move buildings  the first player getting all diy recipes collected by the second player or themselves  whereas the second player only gets the ones they have collected    limited creatures available to catch  in my experience the second player is a lot less likely to get wasps from trees etc  these are probably not all of the limitations for the second player but they are the ones that i have stumbled upon it is a great game for the first player but i would not buy if you are wanting to play with others  this just seems like an excuse to make people go out and buy another switch which i believe to be outrageous  expand
1470,bombing this review in the hopes that nintendo release an update to change the issues with this game beautiful game  really fun and fleshed out with so much to do  for player one only  greedy corporate business logic  trying to pressure people to buy a second switch  its becoming a nintendo trademark 
1471,so i payed around 300 for a brand new switch console  37 bucks or something for an annual online family plan  64 bucks for the game  75 bucks or something for a second controller  and you are telling me my wife and i cannot access the same progression and island control features  that s about the greediest thing i have seen in a while  that s ridiculous nintendo  thank you  it is a shameso i payed around 300 for a brand new switch console  37 bucks or something for an annual online family plan  64 bucks for the game  75 bucks or something for a second controller  and you are telling me my wife and i cannot access the same progression and island control features  that s about the greediest thing i have seen in a while  that s ridiculous nintendo  thank you  it is a shame because this game is beautiful  relaxing  and cute  but the limitations to the second player are completely experience killing  expand

1475,i was super exited for this game when it was first announced  animal crossing is my favorite video game series  the wait was brutal  but was it worth it in the end  i would say it is  the graphics look pretty nice  the music is cheery and relaxing  and the villagers are even more enjoyable than in previous games  this game isn t perfect though  it does not actually become like animal crossingi was super exited for this game when it was first announced  animal crossing is my favorite video game series  the wait was brutal  but was it worth it in the end  i would say it is  the graphics look pretty nice  the music is cheery and relaxing  and the villagers are even more enjoyable than in previous games  this game isn t perfect though  it does not actually become like animal crossing for 10 20 hours  the good news is it is still fun during the beginning  the whole crafting mechanic is really only for those early hours  once i livened up my island  cleverly named island  i rarely ever crafted after that  i wouldo not appreciate how desperate it is noto be different from the rest of the series  because i really miss some of the old characters  i wouldo love the new ones  and at least dr  shrunk isn t in this game  i wouldo love this game  but there are a few problems that keep it from getting a 10  for one thing  why is nothere istill a 10 villager limit  the first game had 15  island is big enough to fit a few extra people  or animals  i would even settle for 12  also when you use a nook miles ticket to visit a deserted island  it is a really cool idea  but the island is way too tiny  so there is nothing to do  and a villager will only appear there when your town isn t full  i really want to get some of the new villagers  but i cannot when it is restricting your opportunities  granted  i was lucky enough to find judy  a new cub  on an island  but that was after farming like 10 tickets  also  there have only been 8 new villagers shown at this point  are those the only new ones  i amean  i really like them  but that s just pitiful  the amiibo functionality is good too  but the crossover villagers from welcome amiibo are not in this game  i amiss inkwell  also you just have to get extremely lucky to get a new villager  i really want cyd the elephant and raymond the cat in my town  but there is no amiibo for them  i am suprised that i was able to talk about the negatives for so long  now on to the positives  let me just say i have not been this happy playing a video game since maybe never  this might be the happiest game ever made  i bet it could cure depression  i am serious  the characters in this game are way cuter and funnier here than in any other animal crossing game  everyone has their favorite one ones  but this gave me several new favorites  and i love my old favorites even more  this game also has a lot of funny dialogue  maybe more than paper mario  color splash  this game has so much personality  and i love it  its just so much fun  even pulling weeds is fun now  this game is my 3rd favorite animal crossing game  my 4th favorite switch game  and is probably in my top 20 games of all time  it really satisfied my expectations  it was pretty much exactly as good as i thought it would be  most games nowadays are either slightly better or slightly worse than you expect it to be  the delays and stuff were really painful  but it was worth the wait  and every switch owner needs this game   also why are so many people complaining about the first player doing all the hard work for you  the others players get to enjoy animal crossing sooner  expand

1489,i would not have purchased this game if i had known there was only 1 island per console 
1490,let me change the resident representative  nintendo   stop money grabbing and trying to make us buy another  300 console and  60 game  and warn people before they start their save file
1491,this game would be perfect if your the island rep  everyone else gets to play the f2p version 
1492,spoiler alert  cannot be played by two players on the same island on the same switch  everything the second player does or picks up vanishes 
1493,very limited multiplayer play unless you own two consoles   the loading screen for multiplayer is so annoying and long
1494,apart from what the other users have to say about this game being frustrating as a second player  animal crossing  new horizons evokes a very real anxiety during this notime of isolation  with only one island and limited resources  this game is more reflective of quarantine than island life  in a time when you have no control  playing new horizons as the second player is amplified by theapart from what the other users have to say about this game being frustrating as a second player  animal crossing  new horizons evokes a very real anxiety during this notime of isolation  with only one island and limited resources  this game is more reflective of quarantine than island life  in a time when you have no control  playing new horizons as the second player is amplified by the limited choices and control of  your  island  expand
1495,had lots of fun with it for first 2 days  but it is a super slow game after that  got to the point where i enter game  pay off loan and quit for the day  do not know if its gonna pick up after but i wouldo not fell like it 
1496,this game epitomizes nintendo s anti consumerism  the ways this game goes about save files and local multiplayer is archaic and ridiculous  nintendo purposely limits any additional player in ways that force people into purchasing multiple switches if they would like to enjoy the game with another person  as an additional player you are limited to being basically useless  nintendo has alsothis game epitomizes nintendo s anti consumerism  the ways this game goes about save files and local multiplayer is archaic and ridiculous  nintendo purposely limits any additional player in ways that force people into purchasing multiple switches if they would like to enjoy the game with another person  as an additional player you are limited to being basically useless  nintendo has also limited the player to a single island save file per switch  with no cloud saves or file transfer  if you own two switches  too bad  if you share a console and want to have separate islands  too bad  if you want to enjoy the game with a family member  partner  or friend on a single console  too bad  there is not a single technical limitation to create the major flaws of this game  the issue is nintendo s greed and desire to take advantage of their blindly loyal fanbase  nintendo is nothe ea of the first party and should be treated as such  do not let nintendo spit in your face  do not buy new horizons  expand
1497,full experience for all players  it is not a cheap game every household deserves a whole game 
1498,my wife started playing before me  no option to create my own island and being the 2nd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  you have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience  that s unacceptable 
1499,my daughters and i enjoyed playing the game until we discovered that there can be only one island saved per console and one person controlling it   that s deal buster as 3 of us share one console and it is a ridiculous limitation   if nintendo patches this i ll change the scoring to 8 
1500,the game isn t playable if you have more than one family member who wants to play  so i guess choose your favorite family member  only 1 island allowed  unless developers update that restriction 
1501,the second player options are needlessly limited  avoid this game if you want to do family co op 
1502,animal crossing is a nice game if you are the only one using the switch like many others here i cannot enjoy the game to the fullest since i am sharing the island and i was not the first to start the story  i already have problems and i just started  cannot give donations  cannot get an axe  cannot help with the progress of the island  etc  it just feels like i have no purpose at all other thenanimal crossing is a nice game if you are the only one using the switch like many others here i cannot enjoy the game to the fullest since i am sharing the island and i was not the first to start the story  i already have problems and i just started  cannot give donations  cannot get an axe  cannot help with the progress of the island  etc  it just feels like i have no purpose at all other then helping the first user   really hope nintendo will be able to change this issue  expand
1503,this game is almost perfect  if you love games that relax you then this is nothe game for you  if you have multiple people using your switch however  look at other games  the inability to create multiple islands on one switch makes it iso that there has to be a  primary user is nothe first person who plays  which does not sound like an issue but the game does not accommodate for the person whothis game is almost perfect  if you love games that relax you then this is nothe game for you  if you have multiple people using your switch however  look at other games  the inability to create multiple islands on one switch makes it iso that there has to be a  primary user is nothe first person who plays  which does not sound like an issue but the game does not accommodate for the person who plays as player 2  if player one gathers all the resources of the day there is nothing left for player two to collect and hence nothing for them to do  player one can upgrade their house  upgrade and create all the shops  and customize the landscape and transform the deserted island into a city  what can player 2 do  nothing except upgrade your house  an obvious attempt from nintendo to get people to buy more switches  in the past you could switch out you save card  you cannot mess with your saves in this game  you cant even send your data to the cloud to switch off saves because nintendo does not allow cloud saves  which also means if u lose break your switch the hundreds of hours you put into the game will be lost and you have to start all over  if nintendo wants to make everyone live on the same island then there has to be equal accommodation for everyone on the island  but there isn t  expand
1504,if you have your own personal switch that you play without the need to share  this game could easily be a 10 for you  however  as someone who shares a switch with their family  this game is extremely disappointing and limiting considering the fact that only one person can play the game to its full potential  i am appalled at the idea of forcing all owners of the switch onto one islandif you have your own personal switch that you play without the need to share  this game could easily be a 10 for you  however  as someone who shares a switch with their family  this game is extremely disappointing and limiting considering the fact that only one person can play the game to its full potential  i am appalled at the idea of forcing all owners of the switch onto one island where only one player has full control over progression while others fight over the limited daily resources  how unbelievably stupid was that decision  i know many will argue that this is how animal crossing games have always been  so  that does not make the decision good  for instance  breath of the wild was an instant hit in my household  this could not be the case if everyone was locked into the same save  instead  everyone had their own save and could make their own decisions  scratch that with animal crossing  my younger sister was eager the play after me  but could not find anything to do after 5 minutes  for a second player  this game deserves a 0 10  this stands true until every individual profile has the option to tend to their own individual island  it just ruins the experience  i hope these negative user reviews open nintendo s eyes to this frustrating issue  especially since the nintendo switch is advertised as a console to be shared  expand
1505,i thing the game is pretty good if you are the only one playing it  but i was a second player  and as a second player i give this game a 5  my sister wanted the game and she was the first one to play it  and after i started playing too  as soon as i wouldiscovered that i could not create a new island for myself i knew this was going the same way as new leaf except this notime it is worse andi thing the game is pretty good if you are the only one playing it  but i was a second player  and as a second player i give this game a 5  my sister wanted the game and she was the first one to play it  and after i started playing too  as soon as i wouldiscovered that i could not create a new island for myself i knew this was going the same way as new leaf except this notime it is worse and buying another copy of the game isn t gonna solve the problem  you have instead to buy a new switch  and i am not really willing to spend  200 for a nintendo switch lite just for animal crossing  at this point  i would be happy even if they added multiple islands as a  30 dlc  even if i know that would upset many people  because that s something i can actually afford i wouldo not even really get why this is supposed to be a good marketing strategy  since most people are just gonna be like me and cannot afford another console  the only people i could see buying multiple consoles are people like famous streamers or youtubers having only one island per switch would have been fine if all the players could do the same thing  but only the first player can progress  and since my sister plays a lot less than me i just feel like i cannot do anything and my experience is extremely limited  and due to this i just cannot really fully enjoy the game  knowing all the time that your experience is nothis limited for me is just annoying this review is based on my experience as a second player and i get that you may have a different opinion if you were the first player  if i was the first player too i would probably have the same opinion as you so long story short  it is not a bad game  but if you are the second player your experience is severely limited and you cannot fully enjoy the game i wouldo not want to sound like just another review bomber who goes like game bad  nintendo   ea  i hope i wouldo not sound like one  hope this sounds more like actual criticism  this is nothe actual first review i wrote  because i felt like i needed to share how and why i am not completely enjoying the game  expand
1506,great game besides the fact the first player gets all the progression and basically all of the useful choices  while everyone else basically just gets told go buy another switch to get that experience even after buying a 60 dollar game   and if that s your defense piss off you clearly did not pay for yours yourself  like that makes evensense  oh the 60 dollar game screws anyone that did notgreat game besides the fact the first player gets all the progression and basically all of the useful choices  while everyone else basically just gets told go buy another switch to get that experience even after buying a 60 dollar game   and if that s your defense piss off you clearly did not pay for yours yourself  like that makes evensense  oh the 60 dollar game screws anyone that did not start up the game first ehh whatever quit crying spend another 260 on a new switch  you sound dumb end of story  expand
1507,all of the positive reviews are from people who had the game to themselves  for a family it is just not fun that only one person can have the full game experience  there is really no good reason for it  the original gamecube version in 2001 only required you have additional memory cards  not multiple gamecubes  now in 2020 we need multiple switch consoles to do the same thing  massive stepall of the positive reviews are from people who had the game to themselves  for a family it is just not fun that only one person can have the full game experience  there is really no good reason for it  the original gamecube version in 2001 only required you have additional memory cards  not multiple gamecubes  now in 2020 we need multiple switch consoles to do the same thing  massive step backwards  also  this game is nearly identical to every other version in every meaningful way  the quality of life improvements they added would be the equivalent of a free patch for any other major release  but in animal crossing you pay full price for a new game  listen  i love the switch and i love nintendo  but it is a miss for me  if you never played an animal crossing game  and you want a very chill relaxed game to play  and you are the only gamer in your house  maybe you could give it a shot   or if you are just hopelessly addicted to animal crossing i suppose you might still think this is great  for everyone else  avoid it  expand
1508,one island per console pretty much ruins it  at the very least there ishould be an option to allow players on the same console to have equal power when it comes to decision making within the island 
1509,a big fat zero  why  because i wouldo not own a switch but was going to buy the game and then borrow my son in laws switch to play it on  but when i get my own switch i would have to start from complete scratch because there is no cloud save option and you cannot transfer your island to a different switch  was going to buy a switch for this game  but now big n isn t getting a dime from me 
1510,i am so torn on this game  for a single player  the game is fine  it is exactly what you would expect from an animal crossing game  if  however  you share a console or what to play multiplayer with a friend  you might as well give this game a hard pass  nintendo has once again proven to be 20 years behind on modern online features  and has implemented what i can only describe as hardwarei am so torn on this game  for a single player  the game is fine  it is exactly what you would expect from an animal crossing game  if  however  you share a console or what to play multiplayer with a friend  you might as well give this game a hard pass  nintendo has once again proven to be 20 years behind on modern online features  and has implemented what i can only describe as hardware based drm  the first player to boot up the game will automatically become the primary player  meaning that the game cannot and will not allow any other player from progressing the game  each individual user profile cannot make their own game to play and they will all share the island   yes  each switch can only have one island  it is not so bad if you are playing together but as two separate people playing at different times  anybody other than the first player is little more than a glorified visitor  when the first player progresses and unlocks furniture that can only be unlocked through progressing the game  save for complete rng gifts  the other players get the shaft and do not get the recipes  they have no way of acquiring many pieces of furniture  other players cannot have conversations with villagers  take progression requests from tom nook  or even deliver materials for a request that the primary player has already gotten  they cannot teraform  build bridges  pick out plots for houses  they cannot even use emotes because a villager has to tell you about them before you can use them  but villagers will not talk to the other players with the amount of things the other players cannot do there might as well not even be multiplayer and this is all before mentioning the excruciatingly slow and tedious menus  you have to go through 3 prompts just to open your island up to friends  the menus function as if they were designed for a 3 year old to be sure they know what they are doing  every  single  time  you catch a fish it has to zoom in  play an animation  and tell you that you caught a fish and say some dumb fish pun oh and any time somebody comes to your island  for some reason the game has to take you to a 30 second loading screen  incredibly tedious if you have more than one friend  why cannot i continue playing while they load in all in all the game is held back tremendously by all the completely ridiculous and unnecessary restrictions  but that s good ol nintendo for you  any other company would be thrashed for the amount of ridiculous limitations nintendo has put in animal crossing  expand
1511,see  reviewing animal crossing  new horizons is quite hard because you are essentially reviewing two games  the first game is animal crossing  representative s new horizons  the other is animal crossing  build a house the thing is  is nothat if you are the representative then this game is great  you get to contribute to the island and do a lot of events  progress through the game see  reviewing animal crossing  new horizons is quite hard because you are essentially reviewing two games  the first game is animal crossing  representative s new horizons  the other is animal crossing  build a house the thing is  is nothat if you are the representative then this game is great  you get to contribute to the island and do a lot of events  progress through the game  and just relax and have fun in general  it is a crying shame that nintendo did not see this extreme design flaw  because otherwise i would ve given this game a 10 normally on the nintendo switch  you can play one game on multiple profiles  letting families and such other groups have an equal amount of fun in a singleplayer game on a single switch  now  nintendo had the  great  idea to make it iso you can only have one island per console  animal crossing treats the switch as a huge save file  now this would be fine  if all profiles users of the switch could contribute to the island  well no  only the representative has any control of the island  which means any other player can literally do nothing in the game at all  this is so extreme that i had to look at tutorials to see how i could get the recipe for the axe  which turned out to be that i had to pay for it  to get the vaulting pole  i had to go onto my sisters account and give bugs to tom nook just so i could progress  this issue is so extreme in fact  that most of the time you will have to pay bells to get tools  either that or wait for the representative to do something specific  now you can probably see why this would suck for a family or a friend or couple  but this gets worse  there is near nothing a second player can do in this game other than develop their house  that s it  this game turns from a relaxing game where you can have fun and develop your island  to a house maker simulator  this oversight really nukes the enjoyment of the game overall  i hope nintendo can fix this big issue and restore my enjoyment in the game  for now though this has killed any will in me to continue playing  for now  i have to give this game a 1 due to my personal experience  expand
1512,very disappointing was excited  to have my own island but had share and 2 player mode is awful why isn t spilt screen the fact we cannot make more islands is worst than ea f ck you nintendo  i feel very lost doing things i am new player and there is no real sense of direction and it took me 20 to figure out how to fish
1513,one island   per console   as everyone else stated  this is a real jerk move by nintendo  i have three in my household that play  i was the last one to log on  the experience is noterrible if you are not the island creator i wouldo not play anymore 
1514,nintendo  this is greedy  the only reason to limit one island per console is noto force your gamers to buy more switch console  please listen to your gamers  i am a long time fan of the series and is really disappointed to see this happening on switch console  the purpose of having different gaming account on your console is for your gamers to enjoy their gamers independently 
1515,it is extremely unfortunate that play is restricted like this  if i could have my own island  separate from my sibling s  i would be fine if it could not access the internet or whatever  i wouldo not need to visit anyone else s island  i just want my own place to play  honestly  such a bummer 
1516,i wouldo not understand why is it one island per console  also implement better activities for co op even if you have 2 consoles there is not that much to do 
1517,well  my brother and i just found out that he cannot create his own island on animal crossing or actually do much of anything since he s considered to be player 2 and needs me to do everything before he can  tthis sucks and just feels like nintendo trying to force us to buy not only a second copy of the game  but also a second switch since there can only be one save file per switch 
1518,firstly  i would like to say that this game absolutely worth the wait  it is clear that the development team put in a lot of effort and care into each detail  interaction and activity  and is what makes this game so charming to look at and play  secondly  whilst i understand that nintendo are being a bit greedy with money  these review bombs are utter rubbish as they complain aboutfirstly  i would like to say that this game absolutely worth the wait  it is clear that the development team put in a lot of effort and care into each detail  interaction and activity  and is what makes this game so charming to look at and play  secondly  whilst i understand that nintendo are being a bit greedy with money  these review bombs are utter rubbish as they complain about something that has been a part of animal crossing from day one  the fact that one copy of the game comes with one town or island in this case  they even addressed this in the direct  people enjoy complaining to gain attention it iseems  and lastly  this game may have its faults and short comings  as no game is perfect  but it has a good sense of longevity  it is a game you can play for years to come my score  9 8 10  expand
1519,i have requested a refund for my digital purchase of this notitle after discovering that the game is locked to one save file per console  every other title we own for the switch allows a save file for each account  there was nothing to indicate such a limitation would be in place  ridiculous 
1520,i will only fix my score once nintendo allows us to move the resident services building  get rid of the campsite  craft in bulk  and have additional islands on the same console otherwise i would give the game an 8 
1521,best game that i have ever played  so much thought and care went into turning this into a genuinely immersive experience  personally  the 1 island per switch problem did not affect me as i have my own personal switch and my brother who also plays has his own  the characters are  way more lifelike than in animal crossing new leaf and i feel like my island is notruly mine  you can placebest game that i have ever played  so much thought and care went into turning this into a genuinely immersive experience  personally  the 1 island per switch problem did not affect me as i have my own personal switch and my brother who also plays has his own  the characters are  way more lifelike than in animal crossing new leaf and i feel like my island is notruly mine  you can place furniture inside or outside as well as building shops  bridges  ramps and even a giant robot  with the shops you can find carefully designed furniture and clothing  most of the furniture you buy can even be customized into multiple styles  truly making it feel like yours  you can also craft your own furniture such as chairs  tables and beds  it makes it feel like you have a part in your island life  with the clothing  store you can buy hats  shirts  pants and more  unfortunately this game has been review bombed by people who in the end will not make change  this is nothe best switch game and i highly recommend  this game is a 10 10  not 5 7  expand
1522,the one island one user per switch makes no sense  when the switch was designed to be a multi user platform 
1523,the game looked amazing when i first heard about it  i have always loved animal crossing games  but this one not so much  i hate it because the first one to start up the game becomes the resident representative and gets to choose the island  name it  build houses for the residents  do tasks which lead to the construction of a museum and the construction of a shop  and other various tasks the game looked amazing when i first heard about it  i have always loved animal crossing games  but this one not so much  i hate it because the first one to start up the game becomes the resident representative and gets to choose the island  name it  build houses for the residents  do tasks which lead to the construction of a museum and the construction of a shop  and other various tasks  everyone who starts the game after the resident representative is put into the same island and is unable to do any similar tasks  as someone who isn t the resident representative i have to say it makes it hard to stay interested  my brother who is nothe representative  always gets tasks to do while the only interesting thing i can do is pay off a loan or maybe build furniture  i have to deal with whatever he chooses to do because i have no other choice  it does not give me as much freedom as i expected  the game is supposed to be about how you build your own island and not about favouring someone over others  it forces the others to live on an island which is controlled by someone else  basically  the game ignores what it is supposed to be about i am really disappointed in animal crossing  new horizons  the developers have made a great game but it has a major flaw which makes the game hard for me to enjoy   80 spent just to be let down  thanks nintendo  you could ve done better  expand
1524,bought the game and unfortunately let my brother start the game first  then realized that i became a glorified visitor instead of a game owner at this point  the single console single save file approach is one of if not the most anti consumer move that i have seen recently  this literally made me so sour that my sentiment of  towards the game went from hopeful and excited into rotten sour bought the game and unfortunately let my brother start the game first  then realized that i became a glorified visitor instead of a game owner at this point  the single console single save file approach is one of if not the most anti consumer move that i have seen recently  this literally made me so sour that my sentiment of  towards the game went from hopeful and excited into rotten sour  literally bought the game but cannot play the game  this is nothe very first have not started the game but already gotten hurt by the game  does not feel good at all  very conflicted right now  expand

1526,this games save features and coop features are broken and make the game useless for more than one person to play it  it is an abomination  do not buy 
1527,this is absolutly mediocre game  this game should not exist is so gargabe with awful gameplay and literraly no sense game  nintendo stop reskinning bad games 
1528,i knew this would happen  nintendo switch and the game developers arnt trusted anymore  they ruined mario party  only one person can play on one console
1529,one island for one console  it is a disgrace for a game and a company who want to provide a multisocial gaming experience 
1530,do not allow young children to play first   i amade the mistake of buying this game for myself but allowing my 6 year old to start the game   he started the island  with a misspelled non punctuated name  and got everything going   no major issues there   i am now player 2 but i am held by the short and curlies by my sons progress   he played a few hours the first day but that s all hisdo not allow young children to play first   i amade the mistake of buying this game for myself but allowing my 6 year old to start the game   he started the island  with a misspelled non punctuated name  and got everything going   no major issues there   i am now player 2 but i am held by the short and curlies by my sons progress   he played a few hours the first day but that s all his attention cannotake   i have been playing for three days and i still do not have a shovel because he hasn t progressed yet   this is a major issue honestly  the game is cute and a lot of fun   i just hate that i am unable to do anything because all progress is locked to the first player   i wouldo not mind sharing an island  i think that s kind of fun that we can share decorating and supplies but i am the bigger gamer and i would play this game more if i could do anything other than fish and catch bugs   so  i cannot give it a good grade  expand
1531,extremely disappointed in nintendos decision to only allow 1 island per console  its just a greedy money grabbing tactic that completely ruined thefamily friendly aspect of the game  i was so looking forward to this release but now i am totally turned off  i wouldo not usually leave reviews  but nintendo needs to see that they cannot keep exploiting their customers  i sincerely hope theyextremely disappointed in nintendos decision to only allow 1 island per console  its just a greedy money grabbing tactic that completely ruined thefamily friendly aspect of the game  i was so looking forward to this release but now i am totally turned off  i wouldo not usually leave reviews  but nintendo needs to see that they cannot keep exploiting their customers  i sincerely hope they release a patch for this because as of now  i am no longer particularly interested in supporting their company until they do  which is unlikely  expand

1534,great  except for the fact that you can only have one island per system  which almost completely ruins the experience for people who share a switch
1535,i was excited about this game until i found out the 1 island per console limitation  really need to fix this  i watched my girlfriend play for hours and was excited to start my own island and adventure  then find out that i am stuck on hers  not fun for houses with multiple players  and should be an easy fix regarding save files setup 
1536,great if you are the only person playing on your system  every additional player is a glorified npc who misses out on the entire progression of the game  cannot even buy multiple game copies for one switch to mitigate the issue  some serious bs crippling what is otherwise a phenomenal game 
1537,dear nintendo  my kids and i was waiting the game more than a year  and what for  separate islands and separate saves for each user   this is so basic and obvious requirement  i just cannot understand  why you wouldid it this way 
1538,great game  people need to quit being children and review bombing it  its completely ridiculous to review bomb something over a 1 island per profile limit it doesnt mean they wont add more 
1539,trash game made by greedy company  what else is nothere to say  will never get because of one island per console
1540,i am giving this game a 8 10  although the game would be a 9 10 for me personally  as you all already know by now the one island per console limitation is very stupid  in order to progress in the game you need to person who owns the island to do it  making the other people playing very limited  the game itself is amazing  but the one island per console limitation makes this game not neari am giving this game a 8 10  although the game would be a 9 10 for me personally  as you all already know by now the one island per console limitation is very stupid  in order to progress in the game you need to person who owns the island to do it  making the other people playing very limited  the game itself is amazing  but the one island per console limitation makes this game not near as great as if you are playing solo  personally i would rate it this way if you are playing solo  9 10  and if you are playing with multiple people the experience is not near as great  and i would personally say the game is a 6 10 while playing with multiple people  this could have been pretty easily avoided if nintendo just allowed people to have more than one island per console  overall the game is a must buy if you plan on playing solo  but if you are playing with multiple people the game is not near as great  expand
1541,looking at the game  leaving the 1 island per console thing out of it  it is possibly one of the best games to come out on switch and a must have  it has so much to do and lots of addicting activities that have you coming back for more  just be sure to look at some tips  you will end up discover something new everyday

1550,absolute trash  one island per console  what happens when the wife and both kids want to do different stuff on their own island on one switch
1551,the fact that its encouraging you to buy another switch is ridiculous  they need all players to be able to get involved in building up your town or else it will be very borong 
1552,a lot of the negative reviews are from hardcore gamers who play fps games and use x box 1 s  if you are that type of gamer than good on you but this isn t an fps game  or a hardcore survival game  this is a very casual game definitely worth everyone s time and  i will not spoil it but it takes everything we loved about the gamecube game and fthe following games and expands on the things we loved 
1553,this may be a family friendly game but it is not a family game  only one person can play this game at a time  you can not start a second island in a family game  gameplay is good but i would only recomend  this game if you are buying it for one kid and dont plan to play yourself this one decision ruined a otherwise fine game 
1554,it is a game advertised tone multiplayer focused and even more or less calmed worries about local co op  this feels bordering on lying in your marketing  scummy nintendo is scummy again  this is why i left nintendo a long time ago  nice to know journalists and fanboys are ok with an abusive relationship still 
1555,just imagine  before you are born  god has told you  you can only live in the same house with your first born brother  everything that you need to do  will be planed by your brother you are cut out of most decision making  now  go and live your unless you wanna find a new mum and be the first born this is what is like to be second player in this game  the save file restriction forjust imagine  before you are born  god has told you  you can only live in the same house with your first born brother  everything that you need to do  will be planed by your brother you are cut out of most decision making  now  go and live your unless you wanna find a new mum and be the first born this is what is like to be second player in this game  the save file restriction for each island per console is just too much i wouldo not think this game need any multiplayer as you cannot even share the gaming experience with the people you live the closest greedy developer  nintendo  disgusting  expand
1556,ну что за дичь  полная параша  в которую невозможно играть 
1557,удивительная игра  это очень опасный наркотик  который вызывает привыкание все больше  с каждым часом  проведенным в игре 
1558,an nh is a great game with little quality of life issues for example not being able to craft multiple items and some items can not be stored  but these are just small issues that while annoying they do not ruin what is possibly one of the best games to come out in a long time  so dont let one save per console influence your whole review  yes its annoying but its dosen t mean the game is a zero
1559,i have loved every minute of animal crossing  new horizons  the graphics of the game are beautiful  and the attention to detail is amazing  the possibilities for decorating your island are literally endless  and the pro design feature helps your character feel like  you  decorating your home and your island makes it really feel like you are building a community from the ground up  andi have loved every minute of animal crossing  new horizons  the graphics of the game are beautiful  and the attention to detail is amazing  the possibilities for decorating your island are literally endless  and the pro design feature helps your character feel like  you  decorating your home and your island makes it really feel like you are building a community from the ground up  and that s an amazing feeling to have when you are playing a game like this  new horizons  gameplay is notherapeutic  and you can sink hours into the game without even realizing it  the islanders are all unique  and having all of these different personalities is part of what makes this game so immersive  even the crafting feature  which i was not so excited for before release  is such a great feature to the game  the museum looks beautiful  especially the fish exhibit  the nook miles system is also a great addition to the franchise as an exciting new way to get new islanders to come to your island  overall  the single player experience is a must play for anyone who owns a switch  now  on to the multiplayer  i have to say  some people who have been reviewing this game are not the sharpest tools in the shed  you cannot be mad when you arealize that there is only one island per switch after it was advertised to you  the online multiplayer was amazing from my experience  as you can get your friends to come see your island  and you can go see theirs  this adds to the feeling of community you get from spending countless hours on this game  i would easily give this game a 10 10  expand
1560,i am extremely angry on how nintendo decided to deal with multiplayer  honestly  i would probably rate this at least 4 stars  if i could actually play  my sister bought the family s nintendo switch  so she always gets first pick on what to play and who gets to play  she also bought our copy of new horizons  i was very excited to play  as i had new leaf but got it when i was young andi am extremely angry on how nintendo decided to deal with multiplayer  honestly  i would probably rate this at least 4 stars  if i could actually play  my sister bought the family s nintendo switch  so she always gets first pick on what to play and who gets to play  she also bought our copy of new horizons  i was very excited to play  as i had new leaf but got it when i was young and was not really trying to progress  when she got back  she had played for about the rest of the day  i asked if i could play  and she told me that you can only have 1 island per switch  that is so dumb to me and i wouldo not see any other point of nintendo doing that other then to lure you into buying a new switch console  i still played with her though  and the leader thing is also so dumb  if you are not gonna let everyone have their own experience  at least let us all talk to people and actually be able to go around  i am definitely not buying a  300 console just to play animal crossing  so i really hope they change this  it is obvious that they are doug it for greed  and i would happily buy another  60 game to have my own island  but that wound work either  so good job nintendo  i cant be the only one who is enraged by this  i am not going to buy into your greed and get another console  hopefully this helps anyone looking to buy the game that was advertised as a family game   and i hope you arethink and try not to give greedy nintendo money for this noterrible idea   expand

1572,first time back to animal crossing since wild world  although i cannothink of a few things that could increase the quality of life i think it is amazing and over the last 7 days since launch i have spent most of each day on my island 
1573,it isuch a good game  it is a must buy it looks so good most likely the best looking game on switch rn  would recommend  also the one island thing was shown in the acnh direct so before you buy a game you should of saw the direct before buying to learn about it

1576,to be honest  this is really a good game for a single person since i wouldo not have anyone in my family to play it is really a nice experience
1577,it is been great being able to play this lately with everything being closed and nothing else to do 
1578,cannot stop playing 
1579,it becomes repetitive after a while  after an hour or so of playing there is nothing else to do  it becomes boring repeating the same routine every day and it drags  i amiss the mini games we could do in new leaf being on that island and collecting medals  i also miss doing favours for villagers  i am quite disappointed as i have waited years for this game  it is too slow the crafting systemit becomes repetitive after a while  after an hour or so of playing there is nothing else to do  it becomes boring repeating the same routine every day and it drags  i amiss the mini games we could do in new leaf being on that island and collecting medals  i also miss doing favours for villagers  i am quite disappointed as i have waited years for this game  it is too slow the crafting system is just dull  smashing rocks and cutting trees over and over spoils the fun and becomes more like unwanted chores  you have to carry the gatherings in your pocket to craft them which takes up too much room and it does not link with your storage which is silly there is not enough content for adventure  moving buildings is also expensive and a long process  also upgrading them takes a day  where is nothe fun  expand
1580,the game is wonderfully simple and nuanced with plenty to do and discover  it gives players a reason to put down the game at times  but you keep coming back  there is plenty to discover and do  but gives the player the opportunity to choose the goals they want to accomplish for their play style  unfortunately i got this game to play with my partner for 1 console co op play  there really isthe game is wonderfully simple and nuanced with plenty to do and discover  it gives players a reason to put down the game at times  but you keep coming back  there is plenty to discover and do  but gives the player the opportunity to choose the goals they want to accomplish for their play style  unfortunately i got this game to play with my partner for 1 console co op play  there really is no true way to play this way as was advertised  the second player is essentially an npc  the ui and controls for single console multi player are embarrassing for such a renowned title  i would give this game a 10 if they simply had not even included the feature at all  it is highly misleading  for it to work so well with online and multiple console multi player  it iseems like a regrettable attempt to force console purchasing  i would love input from the studio on why they failed to deliver a coherent single console co op  the ui and controls while in single console multi player come across as if it was an afterthought  it is both hard to use and cumbersome  the inventory or tool selection isn t even available for player 2  is it really that hard to apply the same feature to all players  seems like poor code architecture to me  not to mention the second player cannot participate in the game contents in any meaningful way  player 2 gets a very lazy stream of check with player 1 messages instead of having npcs treat player 2 as a player rather than a tag along npc  overall  for my circumstances  this game has failed in the most important ways which is why i cannot recommend it for users like me  expand
1581,one island per console is a ridiculous and very disappointing design decision  in a household of four people  only one will have a full experience with animal crossing  unless the three remaining people buy their own switch consoles just for this game alone having not played an animal crossing before  learning about this during my wait for the courier essentially killed all my hype 
1582,i hope that nintendo eventually adds multi island support  the game is fun until you start to run into roadblocks that ruin the fun for you if you are not the first person to start the game  the fact that you cannot play the game in full unless you are the primary player is insane 
1583,i would absolutely love this game  if i were able to play it  with nintendos ludicrous decision to limit the game to one island per switch  i can no longer play the game as i share a switch with my girlfriend  this is completely unheard of on a home console  and is not acceptable for a largely single player game  nintendo  please fix this 
1584,i was wainting this game since last year  but now im really disappointed  i play with my brother and i cant experience the game as he does  cause i cant do a s  in the island  its frustrating cause my brother take all the resources and do the fun things while the only thing i can do is fishing or catch bugs besides  that i think this new animal crossing is incredibly better than thei was wainting this game since last year  but now im really disappointed  i play with my brother and i cant experience the game as he does  cause i cant do a s  in the island  its frustrating cause my brother take all the resources and do the fun things while the only thing i can do is fishing or catch bugs besides  that i think this new animal crossing is incredibly better than the other animal so im sad   expand

1587,i really enjoy animal crossing  this game is great  if you are the first player to play the game on the console  i see no reason why they would make it iso that every user on the console has to share an island and that only the first user to play it can enjoy the full experience of the game  it ruins the game for me as i let my brother play the game first  i play the game more and i ami really enjoy animal crossing  this game is great  if you are the first player to play the game on the console  i see no reason why they would make it iso that every user on the console has to share an island and that only the first user to play it can enjoy the full experience of the game  it ruins the game for me as i let my brother play the game first  i play the game more and i am unable to do everything he is able to do  this is what happened to me  i was going to pay half for animal crossing and my brother was supposed to pay for the other half  but we played the game for a while and found out that the second player is extremely limited to what they can do compared to whoever played the game on the console first  not just when you are playing together  but when you are playing alone  just because you were not the first to play the game on the console  it is a huge letdown  i really like the game  but i can barely do anything  even when i am playing alone just because i was not the first to play the game on the console  and it is like that on purpose  so i wouldoubt they will fix it  i ll have to buy a whole new console and copy of the game just to get the full experience  while my brother gets to play it normally i would rather not even play it at all  expand

1590,honteux   je ne vais pas pouvoir y joué   merci nintendo   ma copine a sont îles mais moi je vais pas pouvoir jouer   honteux   dernier jeux nintendo acheté
1591,players giving this game a zero and calling themselves animal crossing fans are a complete joke even without the features they are all crying like babies about  it is still a solid 8 you guys should be ashamed of yourselves
1592,ignore the haters  i bought the game for my partner and she s setting our rate of progress  i am glad we can share our island and take time to explore it together  all of these tryhards are just butthurt because they cannot get what they want immediately  nintendo made the goty 
1593,i wouldo not really care about the one island per switch thing  it does not affect me  but the simple fact i cannot craft multiple items at once is enough for a five  spending the better part of about two minutes to craft a decent amount of fishing bait because it is one at a time is insane  for the love of god nintendo  please allow me to craft all my fishing bait at once 
1594,the best animal crossing game to date  it is even more immersive than the previous ones  and the multiplayer is well done  i cannot put it down and neither can my friends 
1595,i had to create an account just to rate this game and hopefully leave a review people would read  this is easily the best entry in the animal crossing series  incredibly customizable and just breathtaking  the negative reviews touch on pretty much only one singular thing  the lack of multiple islands on a single console  i understand this  it isucks that you cannot have more than one islandi had to create an account just to rate this game and hopefully leave a review people would read  this is easily the best entry in the animal crossing series  incredibly customizable and just breathtaking  the negative reviews touch on pretty much only one singular thing  the lack of multiple islands on a single console  i understand this  it isucks that you cannot have more than one island on a console  however  leaving a zero review because of this factor is not genuine  a ton of people dislike one factor and rate it a zero  it isn t fair  i urge anyone reading this noto look up footage of the game rather than reading these very weird reviews  it is a fantastic game  just know going into it that there is only one island per console  which was explained in a nintendo direct prior to the release of the game  and covered by many gaming news companies  expand
1596,animal crossing new horizons is an amazing game and the perfect addition to my switch library  do not let the people review bombing this game  the game is amazing 
1597,i loved this game and it was very fun  the only problem was the 1 island per switch restrictions and i would give and 8 but some are giving this game a zero just for one flaw alone 
1598,remove the one island per console restriction  it completely ruins the experience for separate profiles on a shared switch  this is a home console that gets shared  not just a handheld pos game
1599,me and my little sister were so excited to play the new animal crossing  it is our first animal crossing game  so we could not wait to play it  when the game arrived i let her play first  but when i started to play on my switch account i realized that there were some things off  it appears that you can only have 1 island per console  that s absolutely ridiculous  there is a reason to haveme and my little sister were so excited to play the new animal crossing  it is our first animal crossing game  so we could not wait to play it  when the game arrived i let her play first  but when i started to play on my switch account i realized that there were some things off  it appears that you can only have 1 island per console  that s absolutely ridiculous  there is a reason to have multiple switch accounts and merging the accounts into 1 game is just wrong  it forces us to buy a new nintendo switch so that we both can enjoy the full experience  she can play the game normally  but i cannot do certain things like  pick an island  naming the island  build bridges  make houses for visitors  cannot have diy recipies and a lot of other things  i basically can only contribute to my sister s island  it is so annoying and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth  my excitement went from 100 to 0 real quick  i was not really following the news before the release  but apparently they mentioned it in a three houses demo live stream  i wouldid not watched the livestream so i wouldid not know  all the websites where they sell the game also did not mention it and the website where i bought the game also said nothing about a 1 island per console thing  even the trailers did not mention it  i am just so mad about this  i have spend 60 euros and i cannot even play the full game  i really want to love this game  it looks hella fun  but as someone who started the game secondly  it feels more like a slave game  i really hope that they update this whole situation  let the player choose if they want to share the island or build their own island  expand
1600,game itself great but i share the switch so feel like a   npc because i am not the island rep and therefore cannot change the island at all
1601,only one island per console  my mum and i used to play animal crossing new leaf when i was a kid both having our seperate worlds where we could do what we want  but now my mum is delegated to a secondary role because i am player 1  that so unfair  we both want to play our own worlds  why is it iso hard to make seperate islands for each account  nintendo did this purposefully  i hopeonly one island per console  my mum and i used to play animal crossing new leaf when i was a kid both having our seperate worlds where we could do what we want  but now my mum is delegated to a secondary role because i am player 1  that so unfair  we both want to play our own worlds  why is it iso hard to make seperate islands for each account  nintendo did this purposefully  i hope their greedy cash snatching arses are happy and content with their choice to do this  do they not know that most familes cannot afford to buy another expensive switch  far out  they sit in their ivory towers not knowing what it is like to be a normal goddamn family trying to make ends meet  such a simple design choice to make when making animal crossing nh  yet this simple decision causes so much goddamn suffering  gonna go refund this stupid game  i wouldo not want to be part of this parasitic corporate behaviour  expand
1602,nos lo compremos mi pareja y yo y nos decepcionamos al ver que no podemos crear una isla cada uno ni que el segundo personaje pueda hacer misiones 
1603,i wouldo not like how you have to go to the airport to send postcards  umm character limit filler 
1604,bad reviews for this game are only complains by people which probably even have not played ac nh this game is so fun and relaxing to play alone or with friends  and they added much new things
1605,i amade a metacritic account specifically for this review  this is not a review bomb  this score actively reflects the amount of joyment i got out of this game keeping in mind the following things 1  the 60 dollar price tag2  the islands limitations3  the gameplay itselfthe game itself looks beautiful  and the core gameplay loop is a lot of fun  this gameplay loop is relativelyi amade a metacritic account specifically for this review  this is not a review bomb  this score actively reflects the amount of joyment i got out of this game keeping in mind the following things 1  the 60 dollar price tag2  the islands limitations3  the gameplay itselfthe game itself looks beautiful  and the core gameplay loop is a lot of fun  this gameplay loop is relatively unaltered for a second player who has to reside on the same island as the first  however  any meaningful progress  and thus reasons to boot up the game at all  has been stripped away for a second  or more  player being player 2  means you can not make progress towards the museum  and thus catching different bugs and fish is moot  it means you can not interact with villagers in the same way  and thus always have to resort to buying every item from the store  instead of being able to find the recipes through the story  and generally means you are living the life of an npc on player 1s island being player 1  on the other hand  provides a well polished and extremely rich game  fully worthy of a score around 9 10  it is a unique life simulator  where everything you accomplishes gives you no small amount of joy in other words  this game is a gem  where one meaningful design flaw ruins the experience for hundreds of thousands of players  which i wouldoubt is an exaggeration i am contributing my own review in the hopes of any sort of change coming to this current setup i am fully aware that having multiple islands per switch is unrealistic  and would also detract from the premise of the game  but i wouldo feel it ishould be possible for active players to have the same sense of wonder and explorations  make npc s give player 2  the same items  allow player 2  to submit their captures to the museum  and allow them to contribute to the building of other items  i understand that the general lay out of a town can be determined by one person  but that does not mean every fun element of the game has to be stripped away thank you for coming to my ted talk  expand
1606,it is a great game but it isucks to be player 2  i bought the game and my girlfriend created her character first  so no i cannot build a museum  cannot build a store and so on  also  if she had already collected most of the resources and watered all flowers  all i can do is go fishing  catching bugs or travel on another island  everything is very cute on the island  but it leaves no content for me 
1607,so  i am not going to review bomb the game like everyone else is  i actually do like this game and see it as a pretty okay game  not the best  not the worst  it is got wonderful fun and interesting villagers  and the game s great for when you just want to sit back and relax while the whole world burns from all the crazy   going on but  here are my main issues with the game islandso  i am not going to review bomb the game like everyone else is  i actually do like this game and see it as a pretty okay game  not the best  not the worst  it is got wonderful fun and interesting villagers  and the game s great for when you just want to sit back and relax while the whole world burns from all the crazy   going on but  here are my main issues with the game island limitation  being restricted to one island per console is kind of a dick move in my opinion especially when i cannot do anything other than upgrade my house because i let my boyfriend make his character island first  the nintendo switch is expensive as all hell  no one s going to buy a second switch just because of that unless they re rich controls  the controls are just  awful  and apparently it is always been like this according to my boyfriend  i feel like with this being a new game  you guys could have fixed the controls so it is not a pain in the ass to whack a rock with a shovel  dig things up  capture bugs or chop down trees  you have no excuse to keep the controls the same as previous titles story progression limitation  as mentioned with island limitation  you  as the secondary player  cannot do   meaning only the first character can do the story while you just sit there doing nothing other than upgrading your own house so you end up having to wait until the the first player does things to do stuff  it really ruins the experience for everyone involved  expand
1608,i have not had animal crossing new horizons yet but from all the videos  gameplays  reviews and all i really love how it is  i really want to get it already haha  it is worth it 
1609,playing this game for one week now  without time cheating  i still have fun  and appreciate the new tasks and changes that i see every day but i am unsure how long this will last i  already very disinterested in what the characters have to say the job of collecting resources  fish  wood  fruit  bugs  in order to grow the town or get new stuff feels more and more like a joylessplaying this game for one week now  without time cheating  i still have fun  and appreciate the new tasks and changes that i see every day but i am unsure how long this will last i  already very disinterested in what the characters have to say the job of collecting resources  fish  wood  fruit  bugs  in order to grow the town or get new stuff feels more and more like a joyless grind especially crafting   buying objects is senseless you cannot use anything except a few simple music instruments bicycles  lawn mowers  scooters  toys   nothing is interactive  everything is just to look at the only thing in this game that you can do besides gathering resources and  placing furniture is  sitting down on things i wish i could tell you how the multiplayer is  but i have no idea nintendo does not let me play this game online i have a huge list of friends that own and play this game but there is no way to connect with them it iseems like i would need to know how to contact those people in real life and then givethem a special generated code to invite them to my island just let me invite people from my friend list please graphics  animation  sound design and atmosphere are all fine but tasks like growing plants  fishing or mining minerals feel very shallow and unrewarding in comparison to stardew valley animal crossing could learn a lot from that game  expand
1610,bought the game for my girlfriend and me  the system that you can only have one island is absolutely   why nintendo  why  destroyed so much fun for me 
1611,updating my review   sharing a single island stinks  and i wish both of us in our house could have an island to place things where we wished  however my previous low review was a bit too harsh   the additional islands make resource sharing easy  so at least both of us can play the game   i really wish nintendo would push out an update to allow saving 1 island per user account though  
1612,i wouldo not have someone else to play with me so i wouldoes not care for that problem  it is a great game i just miss the soundtracks of new leaf i think it is a great idea to only have 1 island  but an update that all new players have the same opportunities as the first player would be niceand you can play the game together as family if your playing co op  so if you cannot play co op togetheri wouldo not have someone else to play with me so i wouldoes not care for that problem  it is a great game i just miss the soundtracks of new leaf i think it is a great idea to only have 1 island  but an update that all new players have the same opportunities as the first player would be niceand you can play the game together as family if your playing co op  so if you cannot play co op together then it is not even playing together as family then go buy your own switch please the same problem was at the 3ds version but nobody was crying why is everybody crying now  expand
1613,this game is cute and family friendly at the first glance  however if you have more than one person who wants to play this game it immedately goes from cute little farming game to frustrating hellscape 
1614,the game is nice  smooth  fun  everything i love into a video game   so my mark is 10 10but  there is a terrible point that is nothe fact that only one island can be created per console  unacceptable  and regarding this decision the game desserves a  9 points markdown so it is 1 10
1615,i hate the fact that only 1 island per console as i believe most of the players would rather have the freedom to develop their island and have their own collections of stuffs by their own  if it is because of local co op function  l would rather not have it  even though i have multiple family members sharing the console
1616,my wife started playing before me  no option to create my own island which is fine but you cannot progress in anything  being the 2nd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  you have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full gamemy wife started playing before me  no option to create my own island which is fine but you cannot progress in anything  being the 2nd player to start on a console sucks  you miss out on so much that only the 1st player gets in terms of activities  resources  etc  it is absolutely terrible  you have to buy a 2nd console if more than one person in your household wants to get the full game experience  that s unacceptable  expand
1617,i felt the need to give my husband his half of the money back when we arealized that he would be a glorified visitor  i started the game first because he drove and i started playing it on the way home after getting it even if we wanted to get another switch and another copy of the game  we cannot   plus that s another  360 down the drain  or  260 if we want drifting issues we cannot geti felt the need to give my husband his half of the money back when we arealized that he would be a glorified visitor  i started the game first because he drove and i started playing it on the way home after getting it even if we wanted to get another switch and another copy of the game  we cannot   plus that s another  360 down the drain  or  260 if we want drifting issues we cannot get fixed out the box  by the time we can we ll both have moved on to something else i enjoy the game a lot more than he does  that s for sure  i am glad that there is bl3 dlc that he can enjoy instead i am sorry i want to spend my  60 the way i want to  expand
1618,one island per console  i wouldont know why nintendo would do that its dumb and doesnt let a familly share the game  if they fix this ill fix my review but for now they deserve 0

1620,i like alot of the new additions to the game such as ladders  pole vault  etc  but the way they treat  player 2  is horrible and not haveing a cloud save save file is a major step in the wrong direction  not to mention haveing to pay a subscription to play online  but its still a good game  i just hope they can fix it later on
1621,i am shocked this game has 5 7  definety critic bomb for absolute no reason  this game is almost perfect and i say almost because nothing is perfect  which means that by game standards is actually perfect  i have not played an animal crossing game before but this one got me really into it  i just love it iso much even though i am not a fan of life sim games but this one is just amazing thei am shocked this game has 5 7  definety critic bomb for absolute no reason  this game is almost perfect and i say almost because nothing is perfect  which means that by game standards is actually perfect  i have not played an animal crossing game before but this one got me really into it  i just love it iso much even though i am not a fan of life sim games but this one is just amazing the online also is amazing  the only little problem which is a little bit annoying is nothat some times it has slow animations in things you must do all the time and it gets irritating but only a little  also in online  everytime someone joins your island you must wait for him to load which takes 1 4 minutes  but besides these  this game is absolute masterpiece  i highly recommend it  no  this is must play actually  expand
1622,this game has been great so far  i think the multiplayer and all the island hopping is super fun  i have spent so many hours already looking for rare fish and bugs  honestly once you start playing you cannot really stop  i cannot wait to see my museum all filled 
1623,i love this game  i have had a blast playing since i got it on release  every minute is enjoyable  from running around collecting fruit to helping your neighbors when they re sick  the game looks excellent  having cute characters while the water effects  shadows  etc  look incredible   the only thing that keeps it away from being a 10 10 is nothe fact that froggy chair isn t in the game  buti love this game  i have had a blast playing since i got it on release  every minute is enjoyable  from running around collecting fruit to helping your neighbors when they re sick  the game looks excellent  having cute characters while the water effects  shadows  etc  look incredible   the only thing that keeps it away from being a 10 10 is nothe fact that froggy chair isn t in the game  but other than that  it is fantastic  expand
1624,as someone who joined into the series well after new leaf initially released  i can say that this game has far exceeded my expectations  the amount of people giving it zeroes is frankly ridiculous  sure  it has some flaws  local multiplayer is limited  and one island per switch isn t ideal  still  as someone who s been sharing the game with three younger siblings since day one  it hasn tas someone who joined into the series well after new leaf initially released  i can say that this game has far exceeded my expectations  the amount of people giving it zeroes is frankly ridiculous  sure  it has some flaws  local multiplayer is limited  and one island per switch isn t ideal  still  as someone who s been sharing the game with three younger siblings since day one  it hasn t actually been an issue for me  it is what we did in new leaf  and it is working well here too  if this kind of game is one you enjoy  something slow paced and peaceful  you would not find a better experience anywhere else  expand
1625,it is perfect to put my mind at ease during these tough times  besides  i bought it for my boyfriend as well  he has never seen the appeal to it  and he loves it now
1626,terrific game everything about it is fun  great to escape the real world for a few hours and everyday you are compelled to come back  easily the best entry in the series
1627,this is a wonderful game  not only does it allow the player more freedom than ever  the ability to customize your island to the full extent is so enjoyable and keeps you playing for hours each day  while time skipping is an option  it isimply takes the fun out of it and it is more enjoyable to experience the game day by day and see your hard work come to fruition in the passing time  mythis is a wonderful game  not only does it allow the player more freedom than ever  the ability to customize your island to the full extent is so enjoyable and keeps you playing for hours each day  while time skipping is an option  it isimply takes the fun out of it and it is more enjoyable to experience the game day by day and see your hard work come to fruition in the passing time  my only complaint is nothe lack of cloud saves  and contrary to popular belief  the lack of multiple islands does not bother me  because the mechanic that hinders player twos progress was in new leaf too  so it is simply a lack of further development and not a step back  expand
1628,animal crossing new horizons is my new favorite video game of all time  i wouldid play both the gcn game and wild world on the ds but i was very little at the time  i got super into the series with new leaf  and this game takes everything good about that game and amps it up to 100 people were complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per console  but honestly i wouldo not care animal crossing new horizons is my new favorite video game of all time  i wouldid play both the gcn game and wild world on the ds but i was very little at the time  i got super into the series with new leaf  and this game takes everything good about that game and amps it up to 100 people were complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per console  but honestly i wouldo not care  me sharing the island with my sister actually made us become closer  i also have not used any online features yet because i wouldo not have any friends with the game single player is where the game truest shines  with adorable characters and gameplay that makes chores fun  i cannot not recommend this people who enjoy just sitting back and relaxing  this game isn t meant for people who like constant action as your meant to sit back  relax and enjoy the little things  expand
1629,although the 1 switch 1 save file is noterribly frustrating  this game is still really amazing  it is simply the best animal crossing game to date 
1630,it is insane to expect us to buy two switches just to actually play multiplayer  especially when you could fully play it all the way back on the gamecube  allow either a second save file or allow us to choose how much control a second player gets  all the way up to and including placing major buildings and getting all diy projects 
1631,if you have a switch for only yourself then i recommend this game but if you have a switch multiple people use  do not  this is really bad and quite frankly really throws me off  you can only have one island on the entire console  so good luck trying to experience all the game has to offer because others will take experiences from you and probably even accidentally steal from you  this isif you have a switch for only yourself then i recommend this game but if you have a switch multiple people use  do not  this is really bad and quite frankly really throws me off  you can only have one island on the entire console  so good luck trying to experience all the game has to offer because others will take experiences from you and probably even accidentally steal from you  this is really bad and nintendo needs to fix it now  expand

1634,i bought this game digitally for my wife and i  started the game under my account  wife wanted to play but cannot play her own game  she has limited abilities to play within my game space  this game does not let more than one person have an island on a nintendo switch  not even if you have multiple accounts  with multiple nintendo online subs  do not support this 
1635,not being the primary player i am not able to do anything but fish and catch bugs  house is paid off and i have caught over 200 fish yet i still do not have a diy recipe for a flimsy axe no matter how many times i talk to tom  blocking progression based on the first person who played the game is noterrible game design and the game has been a disappointing waste of time playing 
1636,my review is based on the fact that i just happened to create my account after a 1st player  a 1st player s review may be totally different  as a 2nd player  you are required to sort of be a 2nd class citizen of the island  it is almost like you are living the life of one of the npc villagers  you are unable to fully experience the whole start an island from the ground up thing the gamemy review is based on the fact that i just happened to create my account after a 1st player  a 1st player s review may be totally different  as a 2nd player  you are required to sort of be a 2nd class citizen of the island  it is almost like you are living the life of one of the npc villagers  you are unable to fully experience the whole start an island from the ground up thing the game was touting  nope  only 1st player can do that  you are hindered until they decided  and only they decide  how the game advances in any meaningful way  this is ridiculous game design  expand
1637,i have never left a game review but i amade an account just to leave one for this game  only having one island per switch is dumb but i can deal with it  not being able to progress as the secondary player is ridiculous  greedy nintendo at it again  i am sure there is people stupid enough to buy a second switch and game just to be able to fully play with another person

1640,while the game is good from what i have seen and looks like fun  only being allowed one island per console is a deal breaker for me  all players should be able to have the same experience  but this isn t possible because only the first player has any creative control over the island ac is finally on a console that allows multiple user profiles  but those do not make a darn bit ofwhile the game is good from what i have seen and looks like fun  only being allowed one island per console is a deal breaker for me  all players should be able to have the same experience  but this isn t possible because only the first player has any creative control over the island ac is finally on a console that allows multiple user profiles  but those do not make a darn bit of difference with this game  nice cash grab  nintendo  we will not buy another animal crossing game  expand

1643,well sadly i got to be the second islander  at first i was excited i got to live with my brother on the same island  but the problems started to appear soon there after  basically there were no resources around  the other villagers are pointless  i cannot even donate for building like come on man i want to help out  nontheless it is a beautiful game  but i just cannot play it basically  iwell sadly i got to be the second islander  at first i was excited i got to live with my brother on the same island  but the problems started to appear soon there after  basically there were no resources around  the other villagers are pointless  i cannot even donate for building like come on man i want to help out  nontheless it is a beautiful game  but i just cannot play it basically  i can only fish and catch bugs to sell and that s it  i am stuck in that same loop and honestly it can get boring  expand
1644,having only one player pretty much be in control of the island sucks and is more of a single person game which was really disheartening  stuff like this cannoturn fans away from playing the game again

1646,minus 9 points for 1 island per switch  you have to share all resources on your island with everyone in your house who plays which causes a lot of unnecessary stress  there is no excuse to have this restriction 
1647,the game is amazing  but the fact that i have to get another switch so my girlfriend can play her own island is insane and is kinda ea levels of greedy  if only i could save my island to the cloud  or even my sd card  she could play  but that s all disabled for reasons 
1648,graphics look amazing from the jump from new leaf to new horizons  the one island per switch does kinda suck  but that s not really a huge concern for me  because i have fun sharing an island with my family  also if it can be fixed with an update then i wouldont think it ishould be counted against  that s just my opinion 
1649,this game is amazing  the review bombing on this website is notruly toxic  yes it is not optimal to play with multiple players on one switch  but this was already mentioned before release  it is not a reason to give it a 0 10  i have been playing daily since march 18th and i can say that this is one of the most fun and relaxing games i have played in a long time  there is so much to do  but allthis game is amazing  the review bombing on this website is notruly toxic  yes it is not optimal to play with multiple players on one switch  but this was already mentioned before release  it is not a reason to give it a 0 10  i have been playing daily since march 18th and i can say that this is one of the most fun and relaxing games i have played in a long time  there is so much to do  but all in your own pace  want to play 20 mins a day  go ahead  or binge it the entire evening farming materials and crafting furniture for your cozy little house  it is up to you  normally i am into action games and shooters but so far i am really enjoying this game and i cannot wait to see what april has in store for us  10 10  expand

1653,i had very high hopes for this game  and i started playing this series as a kid when wild world was released  this game has surpassed all expectations i had  and i have already put so many hours into it  it has all of the elements from the old games plus so much more 
1654,nintendo fix this nothis is nothe worst time to be so greedy  my wife and i were very excited to play our first animal crossing ever  now we are probably just going to skip this one entirely 
1655,sure it isuffers from the inability to make more than one island along with the older animal crossing tripe  but the amount of review bombs for this game is stupidly overblown  it is an incredibly enjoyable game that just has some flaws for groups of people who all want to play  just realize that the limits of accessing others islands for the most part is just the same as a minecraft worldsure it isuffers from the inability to make more than one island along with the older animal crossing tripe  but the amount of review bombs for this game is stupidly overblown  it is an incredibly enjoyable game that just has some flaws for groups of people who all want to play  just realize that the limits of accessing others islands for the most part is just the same as a minecraft world or terraria game  if the owner leave you cannot play on that world again  deal with it and enjoy the great game you wouldo already have  expand

1657,my sister and i share a single switch  we bought it together because we live together and we have enjoyed our games so far  enjoying separate save files for all of the games so far on one system  we shared breath of the wild  which has a much larger map and more detailed graphics   and now when we went to play we learn there is only one island per console   which means if you want to playmy sister and i share a single switch  we bought it together because we live together and we have enjoyed our games so far  enjoying separate save files for all of the games so far on one system  we shared breath of the wild  which has a much larger map and more detailed graphics   and now when we went to play we learn there is only one island per console   which means if you want to play animal crossing your own way you have to buy an entire switch  this problem cant even be fixed with switching  sd cards because the game saves directly to the switch  does this mean that if i wouldid buy a new switch i wouldnt be able to transfer my game save file over as well  i was planning to get a v2 eventually for the extended battery life now i was willing to maybe overlook that  however this game was clearly built for one player  the first player who boots up the system gets to be the island representative  this means that all of the tool advancements  craftable recipes  and any building locations are all decided by player one  this basically makes player two a glorified npc  not only this but i learned that you cant send fish or bugs to a friend  which is so dumb because i purposefully chose the opposite region so i could give my friends cool things they dont have yet i had also hoped to have a great white shark in my room but the display for a shark is now a tiny pool with high walls and you can scarcely see the creature inside  i wouldont know why they decided to change the model to something that looks so awful i am severely disappointed in nintendo for what they have done dont get me wrong the game is fun  but dont expect to play it with anyone  expand
1658,i really have been enjoying the game so far  but the reason for such a low score is one simple reason  the baffling decision to make it iso there is only 1 island per switch console  because of this incompetence  my girlfriend cannot make any progress in the game and now has to wait to see if nintendo will decide to fix this  which should not have been an issue in the first place 
1659,one island per switchseriusly nintendo  in 2020  update the game and make more islands per console 
1660,game limits second person so much  playing game as second account is like being a visitor  fix your game nintendo 
1661,how did anyone think it was a good idea to limit  what is essentially a kid s game  to one player per console  this is besides the annoying terrible controls for placing items in the world  the camera angle is also really terrible for a game where you need to position structures in the world and is especially annoying when trees and structures do not go translucent when the player ishow did anyone think it was a good idea to limit  what is essentially a kid s game  to one player per console  this is besides the annoying terrible controls for placing items in the world  the camera angle is also really terrible for a game where you need to position structures in the world and is especially annoying when trees and structures do not go translucent when the player is behind  they use same generic leaf icon to represent multiple different items in the inventory so you have to select each one to read the text for it  its  shocking that a game like this was released by nintendo in 2020 when a significantly better game like stardew valley exists and was developed by 1 person  expand
1662,once nintendo solves the huge one island per console disaster  we ll come back to get update the scores  for sure  huge mistake 
1663,i was going to buy this game until i realized it is only one island per console  literally the most greedy atrocious thing i have seen since the stuff ea has pulled in the past few years  i will not be purchasing this nothing until they fix multiplayer and fix this piece of crap 1 island per switch rule 
1664,the multiplayer design decisions are completely insane  how do you put such little thought into the fact that the switch is a home console with multiple users  this would be such a nice game to enjoy with family   significant others  but the gameplay is utterly broken for local multiplayer allow multiple islands per switch  allow secondary players to make progress on their own  figurethe multiplayer design decisions are completely insane  how do you put such little thought into the fact that the switch is a home console with multiple users  this would be such a nice game to enjoy with family   significant others  but the gameplay is utterly broken for local multiplayer allow multiple islands per switch  allow secondary players to make progress on their own  figure out a way to re balance island resources for multiple players  this is absolutely infuriating nintendo literally brands the switch as a family home console  all of their ads show multiple users on one console  how do you miss this  expand
1665,absolutely livid with this game  i am a more serious gamer that is focused on goals and development while my partner is more of a casual gamer that likes to collect bugs and go fishing  unfortunately they are the primary resident and i am the secondary so i am just   out of luck  we have both put in days of work on this game so it is too late to restart and make me the primary  just haveabsolutely livid with this game  i am a more serious gamer that is focused on goals and development while my partner is more of a casual gamer that likes to collect bugs and go fishing  unfortunately they are the primary resident and i am the secondary so i am just   out of luck  we have both put in days of work on this game so it is too late to restart and make me the primary  just have to wait until they are completely done with the game before i can play  loved how nintendo demands i buy a second switch at hundreds of dollars if both people in my house want to play this game during the same month  if i could i would send a bag of flaming   to every developer that helped this happen  desperately hoping for a patch to this issue but i would bet 100 bucks nothing will happen because why would they fix a problem that means consumers have to buy more products  expand
1666,there needs to be multiple islands available per player  most of the game experience is completely ruined for a second player as fundamental gameplay is only available to the starting player 
1667,this game is extremely frustrating for two players  i would ve bought another game but not another switch  it needs to be patched or else there is no enjoyment to be had 
1668,fantastic game  really fun  huge problem though  at first sharing an island did not seem so bad but the person who did not create the island is so restricted to do anything   you both get seperate diy recipes the other cannot use  co op is a mess  so disappointed because i was really enjoying this game until finding this out 
1669,the decent but short story and many of the game s new features are locked behind nintendo s absurd one safe file per switch rule  if you want to play this game with your family  friends  or anybody who plays on the same console as you  do not buy this game  if you are not the first person to play the game on a console  you become a glorified npc that cannot do anything to progress thethe decent but short story and many of the game s new features are locked behind nintendo s absurd one safe file per switch rule  if you want to play this game with your family  friends  or anybody who plays on the same console as you  do not buy this game  if you are not the first person to play the game on a console  you become a glorified npc that cannot do anything to progress the story  nintendo is being aggressively greedy at the expense of their players  it is absolutely ridiculous that nintendo  a company with some of the most skilled  talented  and smart people in the video game industry made such a horrible design decision for no reason other than corporate greed though if you plan to play this game alone  it is a very good animal crossing game reminiscent of the original gamecube game with many new features and an amazing story centered around building a deserted island with nothing but a few tents into a thriving  developed community  my only complaint about the story is nothat i think it ishould be  and can be  longer  the postgame  like all animal crossing games  has tons to offer as i expected  but there are a few omissions from the other games that make the postgame feel like it is missing something  there is no coffee shop  no fortune teller  no theater no barbershop  and only two shops  while the new island customization options and some other smaller features do provide some new postgame content  i wouldo not think they add quite enough to make up for the omissions and i cannot see myself playing this game for years like i wouldid in city folk and new leaf even with the decent gameplay and story  i cannot justify giving this game any points at all because of its glaring design flaw in the one save per switch rule  expand
1670,was going to he a fun game for me and my partner to play  gated progress for just his account  no progress rewards for second profile  cannot have our own islands on the same console  not even interested anymore  too bad he already bought it  i guess only he can enjoy it

1672,a theoretically great game  held back by nintendo s frankly astounding inability to design multiplayer functionality given its  2020  setting aside how completely useless shared console multiplayer is  the online multiplayer feels more like it is teasing you about how good the game  could  have been if nintendo had competent network engineers  to join someone s island  you must be friendsa theoretically great game  held back by nintendo s frankly astounding inability to design multiplayer functionality given its  2020  setting aside how completely useless shared console multiplayer is  the online multiplayer feels more like it is teasing you about how good the game  could  have been if nintendo had competent network engineers  to join someone s island  you must be friends on switch  a process which for some reason still uses friend codes instead of usernames like literally any other platform on the internet  then  you must click through around 30 seconds of dialogue to visit a player  you have to go through this pointless dialogue  every time  but wait  to visit isomeone they have to open their gates  which means going to an ingame location  and clicking through another 30 seconds of pointless dialogue  if you sleep  the gates will close and you have to do it all over again  because of this  visiting another player effectively  always  requires communication through a 3rd party platform to coordinate your visit  no direct messages via your switch account  sorry once you manage to exchange texts  ensure the other person has opened their gate  and go to join them  you are met with an almost minute long unskippable cutscene  this plays  every time  you visit a friend  it locks you  and all players on the island you are joining  once you get there  the island s owner will discover that they are now unable to place move any of their furniture  why  because nintendo has spent a solid 2 decades pretending that the internet does not exist  and so has no engineers on staff that can make online functionality the single player experience is great  but it is not worth  60  it is a fun game  but just go play stardew valley  it has more polish and plays much smoother than this half assed game  it is totally unjustifiable to have a game with multiplayer this bad in 2020  expand

1679,i bought this game  bc i thought it would be relaxing and fun  it probably is for the first player but not for the second player on the island my roommate started her playthrough first and i was excited to start mine too only to be extremely disappointed that i cannot make my own island and instead i have to be stuck on her island as a second player the fact that the second playeri bought this game  bc i thought it would be relaxing and fun  it probably is for the first player but not for the second player on the island my roommate started her playthrough first and i was excited to start mine too only to be extremely disappointed that i cannot make my own island and instead i have to be stuck on her island as a second player the fact that the second player cannot progress through the story like the first one makes it a sad experience   as a second player i am missing the story  some dialogue options and interactions as well as creative control over the island and so the reception of the game changes a lot for me  also  it is not only the story  the mechanics change too   i cannot even get the axe recipe without spending the money  the first player gets it through interactions with tom nook  and while the cost might be similar in both cases  the experience is very different   i really dislike it the restriction of one island per switch is artificial and could easily be changed to one island per profile  i have already paid whole 60  for this game   and because of the limit of one island per console it feels like the price is notoo high  especially when we compare it to other nintendo games at a similar price point like botw which can be played separately on different profiles animal crossing has a family friendly rating and so you would think it would be a family friendly game  but if you want to play with your spouse or have more than one child you would have to buy a whole new switch for both people to enjoy the game on their own instead of having to share an island because of some artificial restrictions also the fact that this cannot be remedied by buying a second game cartridge and only by buying a second switch makes it feel like a cash grab on the side of nintendo  i understand that the saves are stored on the console not the cartridge  but i am sure this could have been remedied in some way i had very high expectations of this game and was looking forward to spending time on my island paradise with cute animal friends  but instead i feel like an npc in my own game and i have to fight over resources with my friend i wish i could give this game a higher score  bc it really is cute and sweet  but i wouldo not feel like i can do that in this situation   thus the low score i hope nintendo rethinks this and patches the game  but i am not very hopeful that it will happen  expand

1697,unplayable if you happen to be sharing the switch with a family member who just wanted to try it out and got bored after first day  whereas i played the game for days before realizing that this situation is making it impossible to progress in the game 
1698,i absolutely love animal crossing and have played every single game prior to this one  i was super excited to play this one    except now i am player 2  and cannot do anything in the game  my wife was excited and made her character first  but she s a casual player and i tend to play every day  she does not want to restart the island and we are in no position to buy another switch andi absolutely love animal crossing and have played every single game prior to this one  i was super excited to play this one    except now i am player 2  and cannot do anything in the game  my wife was excited and made her character first  but she s a casual player and i tend to play every day  she does not want to restart the island and we are in no position to buy another switch and another copy of the game  so why limit us like this  i play animal crossing for the relaxing experience and am now left feeling frustrated beyond belief  i honestly feel like i am just an npc in her game  if covid 19 had not have put us all on lockdown  i would be returning this game  please fix this  nintendo  expand
1699,obnoxious music that cannot be turned down or off  it really is highly annoying because music is by the most part so unbearable nad to loud  you cannot even hear some ingame sounds like the ones from the balloons anymore  it all started to go down hill after zhe community center has been upgraded  beside that the user interface is notesting your patience  for example  if you have a stack ofobnoxious music that cannot be turned down or off  it really is highly annoying because music is by the most part so unbearable nad to loud  you cannot even hear some ingame sounds like the ones from the balloons anymore  it all started to go down hill after zhe community center has been upgraded  beside that the user interface is notesting your patience  for example  if you have a stack of say 40 weeds and you would like to take 20 to sell them sou have to separate one by one until you have 20 additional single weeds in your inventory and after that you have to put them together to a 20 piece stack  letting you click at least 60 times to do that  ridiculous  expand
1700,i had so much fun for the first few days  until i realised that i can never progress this island solely because of the chance of who went first in my household   my partner isn t interested in this game and will not progress the story  so unless i restart and erase all my progress  or play two games at once  i am doomed to a lifetime of fishing and bug catching   extremely disappointing 
1701,my brother played the game first so now the game is essentially unplayable for me 
1702,do not listen to the whining pu c s who did not read up on the multiplayer before buying the game  it is not nintendo s fault they are dumb  the core experience of this game is fun as can be  if you wouldo not cheat it this game can last years and there is no  end  to it  if you never played any animal crossing games this is nothe best one to start with  very easy to learn and tons to do if youdo not listen to the whining pu c s who did not read up on the multiplayer before buying the game  it is not nintendo s fault they are dumb  the core experience of this game is fun as can be  if you wouldo not cheat it this game can last years and there is no  end  to it  if you never played any animal crossing games this is nothe best one to start with  very easy to learn and tons to do if you enjoy it  expand

1706,this game is fantastic  relaxing  a lot to do and achieve  it does not get boring that easily now what s dumb is how people cry about the fact that there is only one island per console  the game is more open than the other entries into the series  cmon  get over yourself and deal with it for now  it isn t even a valid reason for you to rate it with 0 just because of this

1708,allowing only one island and one primary resident per console is unacceptable   had we known  i am not sure if we would have bought it   it is causing hard feelings in my household

1711,as somebody who actually plays the game with 2 players on one console instead of just complaining about it  i actually like this feature  it gives us a lot more interaction with each other  after reading some of the reviews i have seen a lot of misinformation about the 1 island rule  my point is do not trust these 1 or 0 ratings who have not even given the game a chance or even touched the game

1714,this is a good game to play single player   quality gameplay  unique characters  not overly complicated   just an enjoyable game   for anyone who has played the original animal crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset   because you probably played with family members at the time  and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then  this version has somehow managedthis is a good game to play single player   quality gameplay  unique characters  not overly complicated   just an enjoyable game   for anyone who has played the original animal crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset   because you probably played with family members at the time  and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then  this version has somehow managed to ruin even that minimal multiplayer functionality from back then the trade off i suppose is nothat they enabled an okay form of online play   but when it comes to animal crossing the most enjoyable way to play was with others locally who could setup shop in the same town they would be able to progress the town if you were not there  interact with the town folk  the folk then mention them in dialogue the next time you play   and you areally felt like you were living in the same town area   you would be excited to see the what changes they made next or upset that they beat you to it   but hey  that s life   well now that 2nd  3rd  4th player cant progress the story  or help new residents move in   some diy creations are kept from them   and it downright sucks to be that person   multiplayer is a huge part of this game which is why i am giving it a 6 star   last quick bit on their online play  it is okay   at least each person will get their own screen there  but it is not optimized and obviously hasn t gone through any qa testing animal crossing is one of my favorite games so this is why i am taking the time to write this review   ultimately my personal thought is nothey royally messed up this game by not putting really any more than an ounce of thought into the multiplayer aspect   but again the series is great  the concept is great   ultimately they added some interesting content to the game now   i am excited to see what they add in future updates   edit   p s  sadly the local multiplayer issues are enough to where i had to tell my brother to return the game   as he was hoping he d be able to play it with his wife   and once i told him about the issues he was in complete agreeance   it is just not worth buying the game for that   worth pointing that out  because this isnt just some little mistake  they do need to fix it  expand

1716,the whole one island per switch console is a bunch of bs  do not waste your money just play the ds versión at this point  would be a 10 10 game if it did not cause family issues with us not being able to have our own island  disappointed 
1717,one island per console thats ridiculous  if i knew i would not buy it  i will not support this dev in future  thats for sure 
1718,you cannot do anything together story wise if your friends are with you  also one island tether is not fun for party play  if stardew can do it iso can you 
1719,multiplayer is not functional  cannot get any recipes unless first player to start game  cannot do any plot points  fix it nintendo 
1720,y all are being ridiculous  this game is phenomenal and it does not deserve to be review bombed because you can only have one island per system  i get it  kids will not enjoy the feature  but review bombing ignores how otherwise extraordinary this game is 
1721,amazing game  so much fun stuff to do  very well made  both for tv and handheld use  easily worth the money  considering how much fun is noto be had  it makes sense they put in some restrictions  not worth complaining about  you will still get hundreds of hours out of it  each 
1722,having one island is bad but the game is good  but i hope they update the game to have multiple islands

1725,this is nothe dumbest game ive ever played  i played the game in an endless grind for 5 hours straight only to get nowhere on my island and not move the island forward  mr  nook  not only never told me what i should do when asked  no one else on the island helped either    real    this game
1726,i bought this noto play with my daughter  unfortunately nintendo messed up with playing 2 on 1 console  i cannot go through the main story like the first player  i am restricted to wait for that and basically need to buy another switch and another copy of the game  that s useless  otherwise the game is good though 
1727,do not believe the hype and do not drink the kool aid  while this game is graphicallly beautiful and the animal crossing style of gameplay has been taken to new  and better  levels  nintendo made decisions around multi player and family sharing that make this game broken for me personally  the multiplayer shortcomings are not too significant  i like walking around with my son anddo not believe the hype and do not drink the kool aid  while this game is graphicallly beautiful and the animal crossing style of gameplay has been taken to new  and better  levels  nintendo made decisions around multi player and family sharing that make this game broken for me personally  the multiplayer shortcomings are not too significant  i like walking around with my son and discovering new things and showing off our accomplishments  i am not a big online person so i have not tried that part of the game  but i wouldo understand people s frustration at not being able to combine online and local multi player to enhance the experience i am more bothered by the way families  or switch co owners  are required to experience this game  the concept of needing a unique game and unique switch to have separate islands is a blatant cash grab by nintendo  this would not be an issue were the single island shared equally  there is  however  as system where the first person to create a character in the game becomes the island representative  which means they are responsible for decisions such as where new houses will be built  the location of  buildings is not a huge problem as you can spend five minutes sitting together and agreeing on these things  what is a big deal is nothat secondary players are extremely limited in how they can contribute to these endeavors  basically  you can send or give materials to the primary player  but this means that when a secondary player is enjoying the game  progress is halted unless they take out two controllers  my son wants to enjoy the game in a way that is characteristic of secondary player play style  but he is nothe primary player  this has led to a few arguments already as i ask him to focus on an island progression task but he just wants to collect bugs  this would be tolerable if you could switch the primary player or there was some alert that this might happen  but there is absolutely no in game indication of the significance of being the primary player bottom line  we are four days in and have made lots of progress  but we are thinking of starting over to save our family relationship  this game could have been amazing and allowed me to relax and have fun with my kid  but nintendo broke it also  no online backup  seriously  nintendo  i am losing my faith in you as a company  expand

1736,the game literally has no long term objectives local multiplayer is horrible especially since you cant purchase a second switch anywhere  the fact that most of the game is acquiring clothing and furniture for a house i wouldont ever care to expand and i have to wait months and months in real to get new bugs or fish is just insane  ive never traded in a game before or sold it but this onethe game literally has no long term objectives local multiplayer is horrible especially since you cant purchase a second switch anywhere  the fact that most of the game is acquiring clothing and furniture for a house i wouldont ever care to expand and i have to wait months and months in real to get new bugs or fish is just insane  ive never traded in a game before or sold it but this one definitely takes the cake  expand

1741,do not be fooled by the  8 player  tag at the top  this is a single player game  anyone else living on your island cannot do anything but fish and improve their house  if your not player one you literally cannot do anything on the island  what the hell nintendo at least give us the option to change who is nothe main person  was loving the game but now i cannot even play it 
1742,really enjoyed playing the game until i found out about all the restrictions for 2nd players  it does not bother me that the representative gets to choose placement of things but we should all be able to contribute and progress the story town and receive the special items the representative gets

1746,this new animal crossing has some new things like crafting but not all new things are good   because you cannot craft multiple  the time to craft craft things like fish bait is increased to an unacceptable amount   using fish bait as an example you need to 1  go to bench and select craft something  2  select the recipe you want to craft 3  see a cute animation for crafting 4  have yourthis new animal crossing has some new things like crafting but not all new things are good   because you cannot craft multiple  the time to craft craft things like fish bait is increased to an unacceptable amount   using fish bait as an example you need to 1  go to bench and select craft something  2  select the recipe you want to craft 3  see a cute animation for crafting 4  have your character exclaim they made the thing you told them to and 5  select craft something else   repeat as many times as you plan to craft  and this game is getting 10 s   its good but no 10   i give it an 8    1 for the lack of multicraft and  1 for requiring the lower version of a tool to craft the better version  thats adding steps again and has the same problems of multicraft  expand
1747,the best animal crossing has ever been  it is truly a massive upgrade from the past entries in the series  and adds a whole lot of new content  it may have a slow start  but eventually it picks up and shows where it really shines i understand the issue that the people who are review bombing this game have  which is nothat you can only have one save game per system  personally  i play thisthe best animal crossing has ever been  it is truly a massive upgrade from the past entries in the series  and adds a whole lot of new content  it may have a slow start  but eventually it picks up and shows where it really shines i understand the issue that the people who are review bombing this game have  which is nothat you can only have one save game per system  personally  i play this alone so i am fine with it  animal crossing has never been a multiplayer experience  anyway  sure  it is had online multiplayer in the older entries  but the game is mainly single player  it is also never been possible to have more then one town without buying new cartridges before  so i wouldo not see the issue  expand
1748,more fun than i had anticipated  have not played an animal crossing since the gc and ds  i appreciate all the changes they have made to allow to a better flowing game yeah  multiplayer could be better but multiplayer isn t why i love animal crossing if you are a fan of the series  i highly recommend it 
1749,this game is incredible  i have played the series since the original gamecube version  i highly recommend this game for anyone and everyone 
1750,new horizons is such a step forward that it is such a breath of fresh air to the franchise  sure there are some limitations to online which are aggravating but it is not game breaking and it is tolerable what is not is nothe amount of zero ratings because of the issue  i am going to say this once but grow up and stop   on our fun
1751,an amazing game that has been well worth the wait  i feel this is nothe height of the animal crossing series thus far  the island development is a nice change of pace in the series  and each new step in the progress is rewarding and exciting to complete  watching a completely deserted island turn into a bustling community of cute critters is addicting and i cannot think of a better time foran amazing game that has been well worth the wait  i feel this is nothe height of the animal crossing series thus far  the island development is a nice change of pace in the series  and each new step in the progress is rewarding and exciting to complete  watching a completely deserted island turn into a bustling community of cute critters is addicting and i cannot think of a better time for this game than now  expand
1752,i bought this game exclusively for the local multiplayer so i could play with my fiancée and i could not have been more disappointed  there is clearly a decent game in there but it is completely ruined by a clumsy local multiplayer system that involves one player being the  leader  and the other player being utterly worthless  the game allows you to switch leader on the fly but the wholei bought this game exclusively for the local multiplayer so i could play with my fiancée and i could not have been more disappointed  there is clearly a decent game in there but it is completely ruined by a clumsy local multiplayer system that involves one player being the  leader  and the other player being utterly worthless  the game allows you to switch leader on the fly but the whole thing just becomes a confusing mess  who is nothe leader  oh  you are  let us switch so i can pick up this item  okay  now let us switch back so can open my inventory and give you this other item  okay  you ve picked it up  no  wait  you were not the leader  that item s now been sent to the chest by tom nook for no apparent reason  right  well we ll have to waste time heading back over there in a minute  but first i want to do some stuff at my house  i ll need to be leader for that and you will need to sit and wait for a few minutes doing nothing  you know what  just forget it actually  this isn t fun the worst part is nothat this is clearly all in place as a ploy to get you to buy a second switch and two copies of the game  the whole thing stinks of greed and i have lost a ton of respect for nintendo as a result of this if you are playing on your own and you are into these kind of games then there is probably a good time to be had  if your main reason for buying the game is noto play locally with a friend or partner then do not waste your money  expand
1753,multiplayer sucks  it really makes it hard to enjoy the game when you bought it to play with your partner and the second player is so limited it is boring  it makes sense for children sharing the game with one being too young to make decisions but feels ridiculous and a waste of money for adults to play  and do not get me started on the one island per console problem  eye roll stardewmultiplayer sucks  it really makes it hard to enjoy the game when you bought it to play with your partner and the second player is so limited it is boring  it makes sense for children sharing the game with one being too young to make decisions but feels ridiculous and a waste of money for adults to play  and do not get me started on the one island per console problem  eye roll stardew valley makes nintendo look lazy and money hungry for putting this out and marketing it as multiplayer  the animation is cute though and i really hope nintendo beefs up multiplayer  expand
1754,this game does not deserve its high review score as it is unplayable for anyone with more than one user per system the game doesn not  i repeat  does not allow for individual save states  and it does not allow for cloud saves or exporting save states to other consoles this means that  as it happened in my case  you may forever be a mere visitor in your own island a family memberthis game does not deserve its high review score as it is unplayable for anyone with more than one user per system the game doesn not  i repeat  does not allow for individual save states  and it does not allow for cloud saves or exporting save states to other consoles this means that  as it happened in my case  you may forever be a mere visitor in your own island a family member started playing the game before me and is notherefor by default the main account  everyone else  including me  is just a simple resident with a lot of handicaps compared to the main account this is a game about developing your own town on a deserted island yet everyone except the main account practically has no say in how the island should be developed therefor the game is unplayable and absolutely deserves zero points this might have been a fun game if i had the chance to actually experience the game go to hell nintendo  i am so sad and angry and disappointed  there isn t even a way to export a save file so i cannot even throw everyone else off the island and start over  expand
1755,adore this game  cannot put it down  however can be frustrating because it can be incredibly slow  especially at the start  also the one island per console is dumb  but i still love it 
1756,i just start the game three days ago  well  that s what my switch says  i actually cannot remember when i started  just cannot stop playing  you always have something to do and if you wouldo not  just stop playing and continue another time of the day  things change  i am loving this game  my first animal crossing  never played one before 
1757,a true return to form  the game introduces a plethora of qol changes and mechanics to make the island life more engaging and satisfying compared to some previous titles  for the uninitiated the game may be an excellent starting point 
1758,i understand what a lot of people are saying regarding the inability to make more than one island on a console  but for me i am the only one using my console and there is no doubt that this game is a 10 for me  it is absolutely gorgeous  there is so many things to do  and it is so relaxing  the interesting thing is nothat nintendo said many moons ago that this game was only going to have onei understand what a lot of people are saying regarding the inability to make more than one island on a console  but for me i am the only one using my console and there is no doubt that this game is a 10 for me  it is absolutely gorgeous  there is so many things to do  and it is so relaxing  the interesting thing is nothat nintendo said many moons ago that this game was only going to have one island per console  this news is not new  expand
1759,so  the other players in the island have restrictions do something and change this 
1760,most people are complaining about the one island issue but what kills the game for me is nothat they have removed more features then they added in which sucks
1761,if you plan on having multiple users playing this game  dont buy it  for whatever reason the original creator of the island is only given access to progressing in the game  every other user that plays is purely cosmetic and has no purpose in playing as they cannot progress  this ridiculous feature needs to be patched in a future update as it literally ruins the game for everyone except theif you plan on having multiple users playing this game  dont buy it  for whatever reason the original creator of the island is only given access to progressing in the game  every other user that plays is purely cosmetic and has no purpose in playing as they cannot progress  this ridiculous feature needs to be patched in a future update as it literally ruins the game for everyone except the registered users  expand

1769,i love this game so much  been a long time fan of the series  but unfortunately my brother made the island so i am not allowed to enjoy over half the game s content  and even more until he progresses  even with this restriction  i can still find enjoyment in it  but it is so hard to justify the decisions to not allow secondary players to progress the island or make their own the co op is ai love this game so much  been a long time fan of the series  but unfortunately my brother made the island so i am not allowed to enjoy over half the game s content  and even more until he progresses  even with this restriction  i can still find enjoyment in it  but it is so hard to justify the decisions to not allow secondary players to progress the island or make their own the co op is a perfect way to visualize how terrible this system is  the first player  the leader  is nothe only person allowed to interact with anything in the game  the secondary players do not even have access to their inventory  the fact that multiplayer is such an obvious afterthought on a home console animal crossing is ridiculous this needs to be changed  expand
1770,1 island per console is noterrible  while the game is good i cant play it for that very reason 
1771,i cant understand why nintendo decided to go this way of implementing two players on one console the thing is nothat the second player is so strictly restricted what he can achieve  me as island represantive i can donate fishes and stuff to nook my wife which came second cant do this now comes the funny part since my wife had so much fun in the game she played much more than mei cant understand why nintendo decided to go this way of implementing two players on one console the thing is nothat the second player is so strictly restricted what he can achieve  me as island represantive i can donate fishes and stuff to nook my wife which came second cant do this now comes the funny part since my wife had so much fun in the game she played much more than me untill we noticed that only the represantive can do the main things so long story short we had to delete the savegame and start over with my wife as represantive since she plays more than me  expand

1791,the nintendo switch has one of the best profile systems of any game console  each player can have their own profile  and games saves are kept completely separate because of this  i was very surprised to discover that animal crossing  new horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system  the first player to play the game is given the full experience  all other players arethe nintendo switch has one of the best profile systems of any game console  each player can have their own profile  and games saves are kept completely separate because of this  i was very surprised to discover that animal crossing  new horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system  the first player to play the game is given the full experience  all other players are given a downgraded experience  parts of the game are just missing  like naming your island  or choosing its layout  progress in the game for all players is also gated by the primary player s progress  and all players are forced to have the same island  with limited space and limited resources if i would known this  i would not have purchased this game  as we have one switch shared by two kids  how is it fair to let one of them be the island representative  while the other is notreated as a second class citizen by the game searching online i see others trying to excuse nintendo s behavior here  saying animal crossing has always been like that  but 1  this is false  on the 3ds you could only have one game save per cartridge  but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3ds  on the switch you need two separate consoles 2  when classic games with limited save slots are ported to the switch  the number of save slots from the original are normally made  per profile  on the switch  for example  in link s awakening there are only 3 save slots  in the switch version  there are 3 save slots  per profile  likewise  one would expect that animal crossing would have one game save  per profile  on the switch 3  having mis features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player  it is pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed  instead  they have made me strongly consider returning this game  and avoiding their platform in the future  expand
1792,this was gonna be the first animal crossing i played until i found out you are limited to one island per switch  i wouldont wanna play on someone else s island i want my own
1793,i love the game but  i cannot ignore a single feature of the game so it is a 0 10f u  for making review sites like this useless and forcing me to give a 10 to a game that would be a 7 or a 8 due to that issue   put your review bombs up yours 
1794,lovely game  but need to buy a second switch and second game to share this with my wife  1 star until fixed 
1795,if you are the only player or the first player to boot up the game  you will enjoy a polished lonely island experience with crafting and cute characters  but if you share your game everyone who is not player one does not get the same experience  no progress  in couch coop you are simply joining player one  but you wouldont even have an inventory 
1796,a big 0  like many other users for the multisave problem  i bought the game for my sister  hoping i could play with her  but i just cannot bring myself to just play literally half of the game  and force her to play half of it  even if it was a gift  which i bought 60  because of a feature it ishould have for anyone that was going to review positively this game  even if you are nota big 0  like many other users for the multisave problem  i bought the game for my sister  hoping i could play with her  but i just cannot bring myself to just play literally half of the game  and force her to play half of it  even if it was a gift  which i bought 60  because of a feature it ishould have for anyone that was going to review positively this game  even if you are not affected by this problem  i ask of you to be considerate for the other part of the players that cannot fully enjoy the game and lower your score  expand
1797,the game itself is pretty nice  but its one island per switch system is just stupid  i let my roommate get his animal crossing account first because he seemed really excited for the game  however  now my switch is notied down to his account  and i cannot play on my own island  quite a big issue for me because i will be graduating soon and will have to take my switch  then will all histhe game itself is pretty nice  but its one island per switch system is just stupid  i let my roommate get his animal crossing account first because he seemed really excited for the game  however  now my switch is notied down to his account  and i cannot play on my own island  quite a big issue for me because i will be graduating soon and will have to take my switch  then will all his progress become mine  it is quite disgusting how nintendo is making people who want more islands to purchase another switch  quite greedy and i hope they fix this issue soon as i have two copies on my switch  but will not start my second copy as you cannot create your own game  expand
1798,i am second player on the console   means like i am only a player guided character having the same options as npcs   oh wait no  they have more options as i am  nice  i love to be an npc and only running around and doing nothing first player on the island has normal game  and can make every descission  i can do nothing of these  no house building  na gifts for me  no progress  lovely 
1799,i love this game but cannot with good conscience give it a great score  the one island per switch decision stinks of corporate greed  if you are going to limit the island at least do it per game copy  so people are encouraged to buy copies of the game  but as it istands this is just terrible consumer practices 
1800,so bad  so boring  you wouldo absolutely nothing  bought this for my 6 year old  he was the second user  could do very little as all limited to main user  tried to remove me  but had to delete all saved data  for both  in order to do that 
1801,1 island per console breaks the game  the switch is supposed to be a home console shared by the household  this is a terrible experience  no one should have to spend another  300 on an additional switch to enjoy the game to its fullest with a partner friend  boo nintendo  boooooo 
1802,being the second player of the console is nothe worst  not enjoying at all the game
1803,really disappointed with the one island per console rule  was going to play with my brothers and were shocked to see this
1804,my sister is sad because she cannot make any decisions on her own  she feels like she wasted 60 dollars and doesnt have 300   200 for a tv to play with her own towngame is great but ended up wasted 60 dollars during a time when money would be great   
1805,like many others happened to be the second play booting into an island  honestly sucks because it iseemed like a fun game and i see that this decision for the shared island is causing alot people to be discouraged from playing this or even the next one
1806,the one island one switch deal makes this game basically unplayable if there are more then one person playing on the same switch  me and my girlfriend have shared a switch for 2 years without any issue  but now we would need to buy a second switch just so we both get a decent experience   there a so many better ways they could have implemented this  this is just s ty  i know people whothe one island one switch deal makes this game basically unplayable if there are more then one person playing on the same switch  me and my girlfriend have shared a switch for 2 years without any issue  but now we would need to buy a second switch just so we both get a decent experience   there a so many better ways they could have implemented this  this is just s ty  i know people who are out right not even buying the game because of this  expand
1807,i was very excited for this game  in fact it was the first game that i got for switch to play with my girlfriend or by myself  however my girlfriend started playing the game first and then i joined  initially i thought  well it is ok that we can only have one island  i can at least contribute to it  but i was wrong  the single player game is non existent for the second player on thei was very excited for this game  in fact it was the first game that i got for switch to play with my girlfriend or by myself  however my girlfriend started playing the game first and then i joined  initially i thought  well it is ok that we can only have one island  i can at least contribute to it  but i was wrong  the single player game is non existent for the second player on the island  then i thought  ok at least co op should be good  but no co op game is also pretty bad experience  so i gave it 2 because it is a good game for my girlfriend  but for me as the second player is waste of  60    expand
1808,they need to update the game to allow any player sharing the island to advance the game  my wife should be able to play as long as she wants and not have to wait for me to find the time to grind resources so she can keep going  also  why in the world cannot we just go to sleep to advance the game s clock  it is so impracticle and annoying to have to constantly exit the game and change thethey need to update the game to allow any player sharing the island to advance the game  my wife should be able to play as long as she wants and not have to wait for me to find the time to grind resources so she can keep going  also  why in the world cannot we just go to sleep to advance the game s clock  it is so impracticle and annoying to have to constantly exit the game and change the time in our switch s settings whenever we run out of stuff to do  i would much rather have the game have it is own timer rather than follow real world time  expand
1809,comence a jugar 1 semana despues que mi novio y al entrar la isla se compartia  no me permitio el juego disfrutar por completo porque ya habian muchas cosas avanzadas y yo no puedo continuar en la historia  me gusto el juego pero no hay progreso  su multijugador esta muy limitado y yo no puedo crear mi propia isla 
1810,with the whole one island per switch thing it was bound to ruin the game for me or my sister and i happened to have the butt end 
1811,as others have mentioned  the restricted save system has ruined everything  my switch lite developed the infamous joy con drift after only a week of use  now  i am stuck with my save on a broken system  and there is nothing i can do  wasted money on a broken piece of hardware  and wasted money on a game i can no longer play  nintendo is really becoming the most anti consumer game publisheras others have mentioned  the restricted save system has ruined everything  my switch lite developed the infamous joy con drift after only a week of use  now  i am stuck with my save on a broken system  and there is nothing i can do  wasted money on a broken piece of hardware  and wasted money on a game i can no longer play  nintendo is really becoming the most anti consumer game publisher in the industry  expand

1813,i saw all the great reviews for this game so bought it for my wife and me to enjoy  i really enjoyed getting into this game but it all fell apart when my wife logged in to have a go  she tells me we have to share an island which i thought must be wrong  it is a modern 21st century game so multiple  ave files are surely standard  nope is meant that i could not collect resources she hadi saw all the great reviews for this game so bought it for my wife and me to enjoy  i really enjoyed getting into this game but it all fell apart when my wife logged in to have a go  she tells me we have to share an island which i thought must be wrong  it is a modern 21st century game so multiple  ave files are surely standard  nope is meant that i could not collect resources she had collected to progress my game i completed a mission on my next go and she then could not enjoy the mission in her own time  this now feels like chore to enjoy the game as such i have deleted my data so she can enjoy the game at her own pace  unfortunately i cannot return this game for a refund  which would be my ideal solution  as it was a digital download fingers crossed for a patch to fix this poor decision  expand
1814,my wife loved animal crossing back in the day  so i bought this for her  our son wanted to play too  and we saw there was multiplayer so we figured this would be fun to play as a family this is quite possibly the worst multiplayer videogame in existence  what s that  son  you want to play by yourself  do not have too much fun now  because you will ruin the game for everyone else  leavingmy wife loved animal crossing back in the day  so i bought this for her  our son wanted to play too  and we saw there was multiplayer so we figured this would be fun to play as a family this is quite possibly the worst multiplayer videogame in existence  what s that  son  you want to play by yourself  do not have too much fun now  because you will ruin the game for everyone else  leaving them with nothing to do and an empty shell of an experience  oh yeah  also you wouldo not get to play any further in the game until your mom logs in to advance the game  has one brief moment of enjoyment  and then you proceed to ruin the game all over again  it is not his fault that he wants to play a game to have fun  it is nintendo s the lack of multiple save files and a separate multiplayer mode is one of the worst decisions i have ever seen  and i believe they did not even playtest it  either that or they honestly  amd stupidly  thought most people had two switch systems or would buy another  i ll change my review if this ever gets patched  but until then  this game is one of the least enjoyable of all time  no hyperbole  expand
1815,update below ok  the game seems fine  but if you are a family  several kids  multiple accounts on one switch  just dont buy it  every player but the main player is stuck after 30 minutes  you cannot get the ability to create the basic axe  why  1st of all  you can only create one island on one switch  ok  why not  the most active one should be the mayor  it is so sad but let day theyupdate below ok  the game seems fine  but if you are a family  several kids  multiple accounts on one switch  just dont buy it  every player but the main player is stuck after 30 minutes  you cannot get the ability to create the basic axe  why  1st of all  you can only create one island on one switch  ok  why not  the most active one should be the mayor  it is so sad but let day they have a reason for this  actually this is just a stupid restriction then you arealize you cannot create a basic tool because the menu to do it  a dialog with tom nook  just does not exist for non main players  whaaaat  ok  you think ok the main player has to unlock this so others can use it    ahah  no  you cant either it is a bug  so basic   either it is a feature  a deliberate choice  then the game is unusable and the marketing strategy is  like this game   buy each kid a switch  each kid a game and shut up  errrrrrramazing do not buy it  or prepare for a fight at home oh  i almost forgot  the local multiplayer mode  useless  the 2nd player is just a pet following the other  farming for him  more slowly  stupid animation each time you pick up a piece of wood  no split iscreen  no interest at all i ll wait a bit to see if a patch comes out soon  or then i ll throw this piece of nook away hope it helpsupdate   it iseems after 2 or 3 specific actions from the main player  a new key character comes in and all players can finally get all the tools and trigger key improvements even if they re not the main player  still  one common island or many should be a choice one switch player profile should be able to make  expand

1818,we bought this game as a flat and have just discovered that you have to share an island and all progression is notied to the main account  pretty uncool for a console designed to be shared  hoping that an update is released allowing us all to have our own island so that someone other than the primary player can fully enjoy it
1819,while getting the aesthetic on point and being a gorgeous game  it really lacks things to do that actually stay fun also  multiplayer     welcome back in 2006  nothing is allowed in multiplayer and people still have to join one by one  great advertising with up to 8 players on an island to actually do nothing together

1827,i think it is a good game  having played some of the other animal crossings  i think people who play solo just do not realize how bad the multiple player is  you cannot buy a second game to have your own island  you cannot use a separate game card to have your own island  you can only buy another switch and another game  my family has one switch  three people  no problems with any other game i think it is a good game  having played some of the other animal crossings  i think people who play solo just do not realize how bad the multiple player is  you cannot buy a second game to have your own island  you cannot use a separate game card to have your own island  you can only buy another switch and another game  my family has one switch  three people  no problems with any other game  but the thing is if one person completes something neither of the other two get to experience it at all  you can not get the full game experience if multiple people share a switch  it is a horrible design flaw  the switch is a home console  not a single person game device  i wouldo not think the developers thought this nothrough enough and need to fix it  expand

1830,animal crossing  new horizons is nothe best video game in the series in terms of content and features  something that i love in this game as always in the franchise  is nothe closeness it has with reality  now more than ever  time  season  now even choosing in which hemisphere you can place your island  and weather equal to your city s  it also highlights how alive the game is  with dialoguesanimal crossing  new horizons is nothe best video game in the series in terms of content and features  something that i love in this game as always in the franchise  is nothe closeness it has with reality  now more than ever  time  season  now even choosing in which hemisphere you can place your island  and weather equal to your city s  it also highlights how alive the game is  with dialogues from the neighbors that change continuously  not counting those of the main characters  which are very repetitive  and situations between them  that can make you feel as if you were really inside  many people are annoyed that there is only one island per console  but not me personally  and that is one of the many characteristics that make the animal crossing saga unique  the union and trust between the players who live together in the same space  despite this  i have to admit that multiplayer on the same console is somewhat messy  since it does not allow the second player to join the game directly and it has to go through a somewhat slow process  in addition to the fact that in order for him to do any minimum action  the first player must change his position as leader  and although it is a simple and fast process  it tires having to do it many times  still  the control of the character and interface in singleplayer mode is not bad  because i really liked the idea of using a phone as a menu to navigate between the different options  online mode is better than i expected and is an example of how multiplayer should be on the same console  although the transition between when the visitor arrives on the island and when he leaves can be repetitive when you connect many times with friends  but it is still pretty  somewhat long  as a conclusion  i can affirm that each new day on the island feels fresh and eager to start  although progress can feel slow but satisfactory  the new playable crafting and construction features can appeal to both veteran and new players alike  and graphically as well as musically it is very  very good  i am enjoying and having fun with this game and i hope to finish it completely because i liked it a lot  and it is not that it has exceeded my expectations because it was just what i expected but i wouldo not regret buying it at all  it is highly recommended and i assure that those who play it will like it a lot  expand

1832,this is without a doubt my favorite switch game so far  the gameplay is incredibly satisfying and you areally can mold your island into just about anything you want it to be  there are only two things i take issue with though  crafting can be incredibly tedious and it needs a few changes  allow us to craft multiple items at once  skip the low grade tools if we have the necessary materialsthis is without a doubt my favorite switch game so far  the gameplay is incredibly satisfying and you areally can mold your island into just about anything you want it to be  there are only two things i take issue with though  crafting can be incredibly tedious and it needs a few changes  allow us to craft multiple items at once  skip the low grade tools if we have the necessary materials for better ones  secondly  i think allowing players to join you on mystery island expeditions would make the game even more enjoyable  they re fun to play on your own but exploring new islands and finding new materials would be even more exciting with friends  expand
1833,hi  as a 14 year old with two siblings i have a few problems with this game  i have been so hyped for this beautiful game  so when i heard my mum had let us get the game for being good during her stay at the hospital  i was ecstatic  this game is  49 99 and it is worth every penny  it is stunning  the best looking animal crossing game ever  once downloaded  my brother let me watch him ihi  as a 14 year old with two siblings i have a few problems with this game  i have been so hyped for this beautiful game  so when i heard my mum had let us get the game for being good during her stay at the hospital  i was ecstatic  this game is  49 99 and it is worth every penny  it is stunning  the best looking animal crossing game ever  once downloaded  my brother let me watch him i was so excited seeing him play and i was dying to make my own island  however  i soon realised i could not do that  there is a limit of one island to a console  now i understand the reason  it is a great business technique but it is just unfair  my mum was barely able to afford the one we have now and me and my siblings will not be able to share the one island  it will cause too much frustration  resource limitation and progression differentiation is irritating to say the least  me and my sister will not have the same choices and things that my brother will get because he is nothe representative  i love animal crossing because it is a chill game  i cannotake my time and do what i want on my own file  but this makes it impossible to have as much fun as i would have on new leaf  i seriously just want to give up and let my brother have his fun and it breaks my heart  in this current time with this pandemic i just wanna go to a deserted island and forget what s is going on since i cannot see my friends  but this limitation will tear me and my siblings apart which is not what we need i wouldo not want to drag this game because it does not deserve that  it has been amazingly developed and it has so many positives  i wish i could give it 10 10 but i cannot  this one island per console is notoo unfair and too expensive  this game is advertised for families with kids and most kids will have siblings who will also want to play the game and that is not including the parents  now  i wouldo not know about you but my family cannot afford 4 switches  i hope nintendo fix this so i can give it the 10 10 it deserves  expand
1834,good game and i cannot believe people are giving 0 10 reviews  me  my brother and my sister all share the same island and we all are having a great time with the game  i stared the island so yes i wouldo have more stuff to do but my siblings have not complained at all and have told me that there glad i wouldecided to get it iso basically do not listen to the 0 10s and this is a 100  must buy 
1835,awesome i wouldo not get how so many peoples rate 0 just because a second player option  i wouldo not believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward 
1836,if rate this game a 7 5 but going with 8 because of so many unfair reviews here  my critiques 1  there are less fruit   shop varieties than nl  i wish nooks could be upgraded past a shed in this game 2  storage system could really be optimized in several ways at least as an unlock feature  could use a lot more storage space overall  but things like letting work benches store materials if rate this game a 7 5 but going with 8 because of so many unfair reviews here  my critiques 1  there are less fruit   shop varieties than nl  i wish nooks could be upgraded past a shed in this game 2  storage system could really be optimized in several ways at least as an unlock feature  could use a lot more storage space overall  but things like letting work benches store materials  or having ways to access storage outside of your home would be great quality of life features that do not exist right now 3  wish the map had a villager   visitor key tracker since the island is  nicely  big  hard to find anyone tho 4 i amiss being able to unlock services to hire people to water plants and deweed for me in the end game  i amiss the being able to select building projects and have villagers occasionally help submit bells for the cause 5  nl had games you could play with your villagers randomly and have events where they d either invite you over or request to hang out with you in your home i have many hours in and have not seen this   they d also be willing to part with furniture and such to be clear  acnh  added  many features but also took away some that i enjoyed  the  1 issue with this game is you can only have one island per switch  youd have to buy an entirely different system if you have more than one person who wants to play their own file  i wouldo not see this restriction on any other switch game i own so this feels very dissapointing as a decision even if it does not apply to my household situation  the switch system is pricey and families probably were caught off guard by this i still love this game and am enjoying it  the new features i will not spoil are great  expand
1837,a must own for nintendo switch by far the most comprehensive and best animal crossing experience the graphics are great in handheld  but really pop at a level never before seen in docked mode the soundtrack is very chill and absolutely will get stuck n your head this is a very chill game   perfect for all of us stressed out  over worked  and quarantined people 
1838,animal crossing  new horizons is an incredible game and i am so happy it came out at a time when people are locked inside  even after our current events have subsided i expect to be playing this game for a very long time  no other game has the charm of ac and i just cannot wait for what else this game has in store as the seasons change i understand many are upset about the limitation ofanimal crossing  new horizons is an incredible game and i am so happy it came out at a time when people are locked inside  even after our current events have subsided i expect to be playing this game for a very long time  no other game has the charm of ac and i just cannot wait for what else this game has in store as the seasons change i understand many are upset about the limitation of 1 island per console but to review bomb such a great game for this and give it 0 1 2 3 10 is insane  vent and release your frustration elsewhere if you cannot be mature and give an honest rating  expand
1839,first of all  i understand that people have problems with the multiplayer  that should definitely be fixed  and it makes sense that people are upset  however  in my personal experience  this game is amazing i basically live in animal crossing  new horizons nowadays  it is a simple but fantastic game  the multiplayer is definitely flawed  but the rest of the game has so much content andfirst of all  i understand that people have problems with the multiplayer  that should definitely be fixed  and it makes sense that people are upset  however  in my personal experience  this game is amazing i basically live in animal crossing  new horizons nowadays  it is a simple but fantastic game  the multiplayer is definitely flawed  but the rest of the game has so much content and has so much to do at all times  it is basically animal crossing  but in a completely different setting and with crafting  which makes it iso much more interesting than the older games  the multiplayer is nothe only flaw that really affects what i think of the game  and the rest of it is fine tuned to perfection  expand
1840,i like the design and new aesthetics of the game  having played all the previous versions  and even though they have kept having 1 island town throughout the series  it does not execute as properly as on a family console device like the switch 
1841,i amade a metacritic account exclusively to support this wonderful game that so many people seem to misunderstand  animal crossing has always been a game where the first person to play has the most control  it has always been the intention to only have one town per console  despite being able to circumvent that in some of the installments  and most importantly  it has never been abouti amade a metacritic account exclusively to support this wonderful game that so many people seem to misunderstand  animal crossing has always been a game where the first person to play has the most control  it has always been the intention to only have one town per console  despite being able to circumvent that in some of the installments  and most importantly  it has never been about progressing the game animal crossing is a virtual playground where you hang out and customize your house  make friends with villagers  fill the museum  and just generally waste time  not  get to the next objective  if you cannot appreciate a game without clear goals  this isn t the game for you  and that really is okay   but this experience did not appeal to me personally does not equate to a 1 or 0 score from an objective standpoint the things you can do as resident advisor are completely ancillary to the core experience of animal crossing as a whole  and if you areally cannot tolerate asking whoever you share your entire switch console with to share their island with you  maybe you even have to talk to them every couple of days  god forbid  about building a bridge or whatever you are so desperately missing about being player 1  then guess what  you will have to pay the same premium everybody else does to get the same experience to cap this off  a huge shoutout to people who did not like the one island system and gave it a fair  measured score based on an incredible game having one thing you personally do not like about it  i e  4 6  even a 3 if you just do not like the game  you are the real heroes  expand
1842,i never played the original version but got both the one on the 3ds and wii i loved both  this is a great improvement on those game bring new mechanics to the game we all have loved  the shared world has always been a thing so i wouldo not get the outrage but to me it is amazing
1843,this game is fantastic  a brand new feel to the game that pulls it off well  but one question remains  why does this game have so many bad reviews  most of them seem to be bland reviews that are most likely spam

1848,this is my first animal crossing game and it is great  it makes a lot of fun and is really addictive  i could play it forever  the game is just great and very relaxing 
1849,whilst yes  multiplayer is very heavily lacking  that s no reason for the horrible reviews most people are giving it  as a game  let alone an animal crossing game  it is absolutely wonderful full of life and care  as a singleplayer experience  it is absolutely wonderful  i wouldo not honestly understand why people are treating it iso poorly for it is same screen multiplayer  while i can admitwhilst yes  multiplayer is very heavily lacking  that s no reason for the horrible reviews most people are giving it  as a game  let alone an animal crossing game  it is absolutely wonderful full of life and care  as a singleplayer experience  it is absolutely wonderful  i wouldo not honestly understand why people are treating it iso poorly for it is same screen multiplayer  while i can admit it is very strange  and not well done  people are treating it as if it is something that has been in every game and was ruined in this game  this is nothe first time that same screen multiplayer has ever been implemented  so it works alright for what it is  the only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 in my opinion  is nothe fact that others who live on the island other than the first person to move in  can not place things around the island  only in their own home  this notakes away a lot of what this game advertises  and leaves the  game essentially new leaf   crafting  the game is wonderful  and anyone who needs a life sim or something to help them relax from their stressful life should buy this game  expand
1850,its a great game  the bad reviews are literally only about the whole no multiple island thing  sure  it isucks if you want to share or whatever  but  honestly  giving it a 0 because your little brother cannot have his own island  kinda crazy

1852,i honestly cannot recommend this noto any household that has multiple children or others who want to experience the same joy from this game for being lousy to consumers with save file restrictions that are meant to pressure people to buy multiple consoles per household  this game gets a 0 
1853,one island per console  no matter how many copies of the game are purchased  the pinnacle of greed  you expect low income families with multiple kids to buy multiple switch s  get real 
1854,my personal experience of this game was very disappointing  i share a switch my boyfriend and he already started his island a few days before i was able to begin  i am not able to create my own island and i have to live on his  we had completely different experiences of the game right away because he s in charge of the island and gets to decide everything  i was really looking forward tomy personal experience of this game was very disappointing  i share a switch my boyfriend and he already started his island a few days before i was able to begin  i am not able to create my own island and i have to live on his  we had completely different experiences of the game right away because he s in charge of the island and gets to decide everything  i was really looking forward to making my own island but now i am not even sure if i want to play  i wouldo not want to be forced to buying a whole new console and game just so i can have the same game play experience as someone else in my jimenez  bad design  expand
1855,so far from what i have seen  i am slightly disappointed with this game  i enjoy the new features such as the nookphone and the various quality of life fixes  the new museum looks amazing and the graphics look amazing as well  there are  however  many things i am disappointed with  for one  many staple npcs of the series have been cut  brewster  redd  dr  shrunk  harriet  pelly   phyllis so far from what i have seen  i am slightly disappointed with this game  i enjoy the new features such as the nookphone and the various quality of life fixes  the new museum looks amazing and the graphics look amazing as well  there are  however  many things i am disappointed with  for one  many staple npcs of the series have been cut  brewster  redd  dr  shrunk  harriet  pelly   phyllis  and katrina have all been cut  in addition  the art gallery has been entirely cut from the museum  nook s cranny now only has one upgrade  there are very few buildings to construct  the amount of buildings and facilities you construct would be equivalent to the amount of buildings and facilities that would be available day 1 in other games  diving has been removed and the there are now only 6 different kinds of fruits  i am mixed on crafting  on one hand  crafting provides a new and fun way to create certain furniture and outdoor furniture  on the other hand  if you aremove the crafting and the nook miles system from the game  this game would have no substance  i ll just put it this way  this is nothe first animal crossing game where i have had nothing to do except log in  play the game for a total of 10 mins  and sign out  each animal crossing game released up to new horizons was a culmination of everything great from the games previous  this is nothe first game in the series to regress in design and gameplay and that just does not sit well with me  this game was rushed and hopefully  with updates  this game can improve  but for now  this game is all style and no substance  and i ll be sticking to city folk or new leaf  expand
1856,it was an enjoyable game for about 3 minutes until i realized that you have no option to make your own island  instead you have to settle for being just another villager on the island of whoever booted up the game first if you are not the  island representative  you have absolutely no control over your own experience  you cannot even name the island you are on or unlock items at your ownit was an enjoyable game for about 3 minutes until i realized that you have no option to make your own island  instead you have to settle for being just another villager on the island of whoever booted up the game first if you are not the  island representative  you have absolutely no control over your own experience  you cannot even name the island you are on or unlock items at your own pace  you are not playing the game  you are letting someone else s experience dictate what you are able to do you cannot even buy another copy of the game if you want your own island  no  that d be too easy  instead  nintendo decided that each console is only allowed to have one island each  want your own island  be ready to pay  360 for another switch and a separate game cartridge  absolutely ridiculous and nothing but a blatant cash grab  expand
1857,you already know the issue  local multiplayer is nothe worst thing  my sis started it first and now it feels like she has way more power over me and it is clearly emphasized in the game
1858,scummy practice limiting local multiplayer to one fun experience and then a second class experience for anyone else who wants to play on that console  solid effort by nintendo limiting a user s experience to try and force people to purchase an entirely new console just to play a a game they purchased in its full capacity  will not work on me 
1859,i bought this game to play with my daughter who is new to video games  she played first and then i was expecting to join with my own character and help her out  not possible because the game only lets the person who plays first progress through the game  i cannot do anything useful to help her and i am basically playing pared down  demo  of the game rather than having my own experiencesi bought this game to play with my daughter who is new to video games  she played first and then i was expecting to join with my own character and help her out  not possible because the game only lets the person who plays first progress through the game  i cannot do anything useful to help her and i am basically playing pared down  demo  of the game rather than having my own experiences progressing in the game  this should not have been sold as a  multiplayer  game because it is only one person who plays all other accounts basically sit around and wait for the other player s progression if they progress at all  i am not going to delete my daughter s island and start over  really hoping an update balances the players  abilities in the game  very disappointed  expand
1860,the limitation of one island per switch is   nintendo should be ashamed of itself 
1861,this game is fun  if your the first person to play  if your the second or third or so on player than you are pretty much just a visitor that can do basically  much nothing that affects the island  i understand nintendo that they want to sell more switches and make more money but you are ruining the game for lots of people  this is not ok 
1862,1 snow white seven dwarfs  with no power  ridiculous  nintendo knows better than this 
1863,honestly im not sure why alot of people a blowing the fact that you can only have 1 island per switch  its not that big of a deal
1864,if you are the first person to boot up the game you basically are the only person that will have fun playing the game if you are the second person you arealize that what you get to do is extremely limited compared to the first person  every profile should get their own island  if you are the second person to play you lose opportunities  like building structures  having a say in the townsif you are the first person to boot up the game you basically are the only person that will have fun playing the game if you are the second person you arealize that what you get to do is extremely limited compared to the first person  every profile should get their own island  if you are the second person to play you lose opportunities  like building structures  having a say in the towns name  and it is harder for you to get resources to build things  if it was not for these problems this game would be a easy 10 10i wouldoubt that they will fix this problem because nintendo never does  so if you have a family that all want to play this game is a pass  expand
1865,my girlfriend and i are currently arguing over who s going to be responsible for ruining the other s experience by being the primary residence who slows down the other person s play  dumbest multiplayer setup ever and i wish i would known about it before i started as primary because now i want to reset the whole thing
1866,i was really looking forward to this game  however after i wouldid the intro and gave the switch to my boyfriend to play  we found out that it is one island  and that island s resources  so since i had gone through the efforts of doing everything before switching off he had nothing to do  shared per switch  made the game play really ineffective and if i could return it i would  i wouldo not enjoyi was really looking forward to this game  however after i wouldid the intro and gave the switch to my boyfriend to play  we found out that it is one island  and that island s resources  so since i had gone through the efforts of doing everything before switching off he had nothing to do  shared per switch  made the game play really ineffective and if i could return it i would  i wouldo not enjoy the game now as it is more of a who gets to play today rather than a fun thing we get to do  expand

1868,only one person in a household can effectively play the game  ridiculous  we bought this game for our kids to be able to play with their friends online  but it is a non starter with two kids in the household 
1869,whats the point of a family type game if you cant have your own islands  cant even play the game properly because my brother started first  i wanted to play on my own user account but couldnt because part of the game was already there  i wouldid not get to experience the beggining parts of the game and it is extremely frustrating i cant make my own progress without changing my brothers progress 
1870,nintendo s most agregious cash grab and violation of consumer trust to date   for each player you need a separate game and switch console  otherwise the non primary resident  ie  literally second class citizens  are unable to participate in most of the content you imagine i would still give the game some points for the game play the primary citizen can participate in  however the gamenintendo s most agregious cash grab and violation of consumer trust to date   for each player you need a separate game and switch console  otherwise the non primary resident  ie  literally second class citizens  are unable to participate in most of the content you imagine i would still give the game some points for the game play the primary citizen can participate in  however the game was mainly purchased for the family  meaning those the game was intended for are unable to participate in any meaningful way  so 0 points nintendo  wow  how the mighty have fallen  and all in the name of bleeding gamers dry  expand

1874,this game is very fun almost to the point of being addicting  you might be confused by the 0 rating i am giving this  but it is only for one simple reason  which is nothat you are limited to one island per device  it is actually ridiculous that any account added after the original one is forced to be on the same island and follow behind the first player in the story  i amean  how difficult isthis game is very fun almost to the point of being addicting  you might be confused by the 0 rating i am giving this  but it is only for one simple reason  which is nothat you are limited to one island per device  it is actually ridiculous that any account added after the original one is forced to be on the same island and follow behind the first player in the story  i amean  how difficult is it to just make separate saves for different accounts  i wouldo not want to have to miss out on the entirety of the main story having to follow behind the main player  now each player has to compete for resources  land area  everything  the multiplayer option is god awful as well  one player  being the  leader  can play the game normally while the other player is completely helpless  having a simple fix of a split iscreen option would fix this so easily  like please nintendo  it really does not seem like that hard of an update to fix the atrocious single island and multiplayer design you came up with  i amean whose idea was this anyway  it is simply the worst multi player system i have seen in literally any game  every other game on the switch allows you to have multiple game saves  but this one just sucks the fun out of the whole game just because of this design  please please please please please please fix your horrific  system and allow for multiple game saves  multiple islands  and fix the garbage multiplayer system to make it a split iscreen  or just remove the feature all together  it really does not seem like that hard of a fix that would benefit the thousands of other players who are complaining about the same issues  again  the game is really fun  but all that fun goes out the door because of these simple little designs  expand
1875,simplemente es un gran juego  mi esposa no deja de jugar  muchas de las quejas de juegos anteriores fueron escuchadas  es un juego infinito  no tiene limites ni fin  mi esposa simplemente amo el juego  eso si haveo a muchos sonyers con su mala nota por que su humo stranding tiene menor calificación  como sea al es un vende consolas y es un juegazo
1876,i played this game for a while and loved it  i probably put in 20 hours but i was struggling to advance the plot  i put in so much effort paying off debt and gathering resources and going to new islands to invite people to come live on my island and still nothing  later i wouldiscovered i was missing a ton of recipes that the main player of the console also had  well  that was 20 hours wastedi played this game for a while and loved it  i probably put in 20 hours but i was struggling to advance the plot  i put in so much effort paying off debt and gathering resources and going to new islands to invite people to come live on my island and still nothing  later i wouldiscovered i was missing a ton of recipes that the main player of the console also had  well  that was 20 hours wasted because apparently the second player on this game has no responsibility  cannot advance the plot  is missing tons of craft recipes and is generally seen as a much less important player  i am done with this stupid game and i cannot believe i spent  60 on it  pisssseddddd  expand
1877,wow what a total complete scam  i am beyond angry  i spent days playing this game so confused why our island was not advancing  then my boyfriend  who created his character before mine  signs on after days of not playing and gets all the opportunities to progress the island along with free diy recipes  nintendo was not upfront about this one true player per game console  i feel scammed outwow what a total complete scam  i am beyond angry  i spent days playing this game so confused why our island was not advancing  then my boyfriend  who created his character before mine  signs on after days of not playing and gets all the opportunities to progress the island along with free diy recipes  nintendo was not upfront about this one true player per game console  i feel scammed out of my time and money  nintendo needs to fix this  expand
1878,animal crossing be like one to rule them all  with up to 7 slaves who cannot progress on their own 
1879,was super excited to play this game  but there is only one save file per switch  for a console designed for families this sucks  you can have up to 8 characters for one island but only one island and unless you are the mayor you wouldo not get to make meaningful decisions and if one person collects all of the resources for the day  you will have to wait until tomorrow to get your own i am superwas super excited to play this game  but there is only one save file per switch  for a console designed for families this sucks  you can have up to 8 characters for one island but only one island and unless you are the mayor you wouldo not get to make meaningful decisions and if one person collects all of the resources for the day  you will have to wait until tomorrow to get your own i am super disappointed in nintendo for such a massive flaw in what would ve been a great game  was bought for the family  but cannot be used for the family  get it if you are the only person planning on playing  otherwise do not  expand
1880,such a shame  thanks for tethering progression and such to one person  maybe there will be a patch but i wont be holding my breath 
1881,this should be advertised as a single  player game  multiplayer is pointless  you can open your emote options as the second player but not your tool options  nintendo what were you thinking  i wanted to play this with my wife but we have to just take turns because it is no fun to be the second player  you just follow the leader around  i am extremely disappointed with the ant antiquatedthis should be advertised as a single  player game  multiplayer is pointless  you can open your emote options as the second player but not your tool options  nintendo what were you thinking  i wanted to play this with my wife but we have to just take turns because it is no fun to be the second player  you just follow the leader around  i am extremely disappointed with the ant antiquated feel of the multiplayer system and even the online system  i why cannot i be in multiplayer mode and have my wife and i both go visit another person  it is 2020 and if nintendo wants to charge me for online they need to give me features that are worth paying for  i love the game  but have to review it poorly because of the crap job they did with the multiplayer  seems to me that they wanted everyone to go out and buy more switches and extra animal crossing games in order to truly play multiplayer  shame on you nintendo  expand
1882,nothing could have prepared me for how awful this game is  it  was hyped to oblivion  and i bought it at it is full  ludicrous  60 price tag  and the game is nothing  you gather and you sell so you can place and gather  that s it  that s literally the entire game summarized in one sentence  this is a  30 game at best  i am so unfathomably disappointed  i thought this was going to be annothing could have prepared me for how awful this game is  it  was hyped to oblivion  and i bought it at it is full  ludicrous  60 price tag  and the game is nothing  you gather and you sell so you can place and gather  that s it  that s literally the entire game summarized in one sentence  this is a  30 game at best  i am so unfathomably disappointed  i thought this was going to be an amazing experience  and it is nothing  do not get me started on the multiplayer  easily the most antiquated thing i have seen in any modern game  or the fact that you can only have one island  waste of time and money completely  expand
1883,i wouldo not expect there to be different islands per player but the fact that essentially one character gets the story line while the others do nothing is horrible  what a waste of money for everyone to not be able to truly enjoy the game  animal crossing should remove the resident representative role completely or at least make it transferable  this needs to be patched quickly or i am not surei wouldo not expect there to be different islands per player but the fact that essentially one character gets the story line while the others do nothing is horrible  what a waste of money for everyone to not be able to truly enjoy the game  animal crossing should remove the resident representative role completely or at least make it transferable  this needs to be patched quickly or i am not sure i am buying another animal crossing game  it is not as family friendly as it promotes itself to be  expand
1884,love most of the mechanics in the game and i love seeing the community for this game grow but i have one major problem  you cannot have separate islands per switch  ruins the experience for me and the other people in the house since they cannot progress without me playing 
1885,one island per consolei am forced to rate this game very low because of the egregious pricing caused by a limitation put on this game  the limitation of only being able to have one island per console  every other game i have i can share with others in my household  as it currently stands i have to purchase a new console and game per island at a minimum of  400 per save file  on top ofone island per consolei am forced to rate this game very low because of the egregious pricing caused by a limitation put on this game  the limitation of only being able to have one island per console  every other game i have i can share with others in my household  as it currently stands i have to purchase a new console and game per island at a minimum of  400 per save file  on top of this nothere is no cloud save functionality i would happily rate this game a 9 if this was not the case but as it istands family s with multiple children are forced to not buy the game or buy multiple switches so each person has the option to play the same game  a requirement that does not exist for any other game i am aware of on any home console if these two issues are rectified i will update the review score to a 9  expand
1886,i play by sharing the console with my girlfriend  i am the second profile  it is a joke  i have access to no projects  no decisions  i am just decorating the island and giving resources to player 1 i have never seen a game so tightly held  it is a shame  so that we have a great concept game  addictive but which very quickly frustratating the the player 2 
1887,my issues with the game are the lack of any sort of meaningful options menu  the tight unforgiving timing requirements for fishing and certain bug catching  and the shear amount of busywork that the game requires you to do in order to progress  the best ways of making money require a good sense of timing  or those activities can easily take twice as long or longer  i admit  i have a badmy issues with the game are the lack of any sort of meaningful options menu  the tight unforgiving timing requirements for fishing and certain bug catching  and the shear amount of busywork that the game requires you to do in order to progress  the best ways of making money require a good sense of timing  or those activities can easily take twice as long or longer  i admit  i have a bad sense of timing  but i wouldo not play rhythm games  so why are those types of mechanics showing up in a  relaxing island getaway i feel that the game has zero respect for player time  i e  the crafting menu is atrocious  and trying to craft multiple things at once is a nightmare  and players are forced to sit through slow  unchangeable  dialog for most actions they take  also  the arguably biggest achievement  golden tools  are now mostly useless as they only have about 3x the durability of the previous tools  that s right  the things that take almost a year to unlock are not much better than the middle tier of tools  expand
1888,i ll chance my rating if they ever fix the one island player 2 issues nintendo should be ashamed of what they pulled here
1889,really nintendo  you have allowed the switch to hold several accounts  you promoted switch as a family console  and you wouldecide to restrict one island per switch  just like how a new save file can happen in pokemon per account why could you not do that for animal crossing  this is corporate greed 
1890,this is my first user review of any game on mc i specifically created an account to rate this nothinly veiled  cash grabbing  steaming pile of feces a big fat 0 for the sole reason of one island per switch it is absolutely ludicrous that you cannot create an island per profile and expect us to fork out for another 2 3 4  consoles if you live in a household where more than one person wantsthis is my first user review of any game on mc i specifically created an account to rate this nothinly veiled  cash grabbing  steaming pile of feces a big fat 0 for the sole reason of one island per switch it is absolutely ludicrous that you cannot create an island per profile and expect us to fork out for another 2 3 4  consoles if you live in a household where more than one person wants their own experience what an absolutely piss poor design by nintendo  expand
1891,i purchased this game for me and my wife to share  i was hoping we could each have our own islands  but apparently we are forced to share one  what s worst  since she played first she gets all the crafting recipes and storyline choices  and i have been demoted to a second class citizen  i really wanted to enjoy this animal crossing game but we both cannot have our own game on one console andi purchased this game for me and my wife to share  i was hoping we could each have our own islands  but apparently we are forced to share one  what s worst  since she played first she gets all the crafting recipes and storyline choices  and i have been demoted to a second class citizen  i really wanted to enjoy this animal crossing game but we both cannot have our own game on one console and now i cannot get crafting recipes for certain things like bridges  npc buildings  or contribute in any way to our town other than collecting resources and giving them to her nintendo has given this game a massive design flaw and i am honestly really disappointed with how it turned out  expand
1892,i bought this game for my daughter and i to play  i have been a long time animal crossing player  and i got her started on the franchise as soon as she was old enough to play  we had both been anticipating the game for months  i let her start the game and enjoy it for a few days before i logged into my switch profile and started my game  i was extremely disappointed to see that it put me oni bought this game for my daughter and i to play  i have been a long time animal crossing player  and i got her started on the franchise as soon as she was old enough to play  we had both been anticipating the game for months  i let her start the game and enjoy it for a few days before i logged into my switch profile and started my game  i was extremely disappointed to see that it put me on my daughter s island  and i can participate as a glorified visitor  i cannot progress the game in any way  if she collects all the fruit before me for the day  i cannot gather any  as a secondary player  you can basically decorate a house  and interact with the environment  but nothing further  i understand that even if you buy another came card  you cannot have your own island  the only way to do that is noto spend  200 300 for an additional switch console  and another  60 for a second game copy if you want to play together or at the same time  seems like a big money grab from nintendo to sell more switch consoles  extremely disappointed  expand
1893,only one island per switch aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1894,the island save state situation is un acceptable  the game also is really slow at the start even for an animal crossing 
1895,this game is down right terrible  complete laziness by the designers and then locked to one island per switch where only the first person to create a profile can fully advance the island and enjoy the game is a disgusting ploy that feels like they are just trying to sell consoles  the laziness comes about not even having a proper 3rd person camera  i would let usome of this slide if it wasthis game is down right terrible  complete laziness by the designers and then locked to one island per switch where only the first person to create a profile can fully advance the island and enjoy the game is a disgusting ploy that feels like they are just trying to sell consoles  the laziness comes about not even having a proper 3rd person camera  i would let usome of this slide if it was a 20 dollar game at most  i have played free mobile games with better physical control design and options than  it is a cheap game at a high price to try and trick consumers into buying another console to fully enjoy it  when the game falls so flat on its face it would never be worth buying another switch to maybe enjoy it  i hope to god i can return it to wal mart tomorrowthe one game a year i buy for my birthday i budget specifically for i am going to pissed if i am stuck with this dumpster fire  expand
1896,this game is good but only the first player gets to use the game  this just the dumbest thing ever and this is why i am review bombing this game so that the developers realise their error and correct it
1897,only one save  you ruin the game nintendo  i wont buy another switch just for a second save
1898,jeu pas assez long multijoueur plus que nul une seul île par compte moi qui suis un fan d animal crossing et qui est jouer à tout les jeux je trouve celui la vraiment nul
1899,simply terrible local multi player  my wife plays as the 2nd villager  and she is missing lots of recipes and stays blocked on several tasks throughout the game  nintendo needs to fix this asap
1900,one island per switch  i have to let my little sister play and i have to stay player 2
1901,while the 1st player can receive tasks and make progress with the story  all the other players have terrible gameplay  nintendo please fix this by  for instance  alternating the player who tom nook gives tasks to  the game is great  but only for a single player 
1902,one island per switch which is quite underlying the most ridiculous decision ever made  not to mention at this notime where we are in a crisis  and you want us to buy two switches just because people want more than one island on a video game seriously 
1903,get multiple islands per switch and i will change this review score to a 10
1904,i am playing with my girlfriend  built my house  collected some stuff  done  please add a island for every user on the switch console 
1905,it is just a typical mobile grind game with time wall  and poor interface  worst game of the year 
1906,i am second player and nothing to do   totally un acceptable for a 80  game 
1907,only one island per switch  are you serious  that means only one player can evolve the island and play all the missions update needed

1911,one island  poor graphics i think this game really deserve 0 only way to be heard
1912,as a second player  bought this game initially for my gf but also wanted to give it a try  i just cannot enjoy the whole animal crossing story   game  i feel like a visitor on an island who can only collect  sell and upgrade his own house the one island per switch limitation was not even communicated clearly  thanks for nothing  nintendo 
1913,i share a switch with my partner  since they re the primary player  i am stuck with effectively half a game  while i am sure there are ways in which sharing an island would enhance the experience  the way new horizons implements it isn t particularly fun for the secondary players 
1914,i really like animal crossing  new horizons  but the local co op is horrible and a real shame how they treat the secondary characters in the game   already was letdown that we cannot have our own islands  but the fact the main character gets all the island progress quests really ruins the experience for households with more than one user and one switch 
1915,for a  60 game  my whole family should be able to have their own game  i kinda feel duped  sharing an island  really  im not going to buy multiple copies of the same games and multiple  400 game stations for individual accounts  nintendo has gotten so   greedy  this isnt hard to change   the company should fix this  thr game itself is really fun  but this inconvenience makes it veryfor a  60 game  my whole family should be able to have their own game  i kinda feel duped  sharing an island  really  im not going to buy multiple copies of the same games and multiple  400 game stations for individual accounts  nintendo has gotten so   greedy  this isnt hard to change   the company should fix this  thr game itself is really fun  but this inconvenience makes it very disappointing  expand

1920,this is an amazing and relaxing game and it is a shame that people are rating it iso low because you can only have one island per console and knowing nintendo they will probably fix it in the next update like they fixed the multiplayer in mario maker

1925,unfortunately as much as the game is gorgeous and pretty  for me as player two it is just unplayable and does not offer anything  neither can i progress in the game nor can i create my own separate save file as i am sharing the switch with someone else  a hugely absurd design choice for the game that promised so much  shared island could be manageable but limiting progress to player 1 isunfortunately as much as the game is gorgeous and pretty  for me as player two it is just unplayable and does not offer anything  neither can i progress in the game nor can i create my own separate save file as i am sharing the switch with someone else  a hugely absurd design choice for the game that promised so much  shared island could be manageable but limiting progress to player 1 is insane these days  either me or the other person playing will be unsatisfied  unfortunately all the fun is spoiled because of that and except of player 1 there is simply no reason to play  unfortunately i cannot get a refund due to my country s law but if i could i would definitely get it and i regret i actually bought the game and gave my money to nintendo  and the best thing that it was never clearly said in official promoting materials about this limitation  very bad move  will definitely think more than twice about buying any of their games in the future  i truly do not recommend this game if you are gonna play with someone else  do not make my mistake and do not buy it  expand
1926,my wife and i just bought the game   i loved animal crossing when i was a kid and was excited to show her how to play and compare our islands progress   we started off with her account and she got everything set up and started   when i went to create my island i was shocked that all the decisions had been made and i was off to the island my wife created   i amissed out on all decisions andmy wife and i just bought the game   i loved animal crossing when i was a kid and was excited to show her how to play and compare our islands progress   we started off with her account and she got everything set up and started   when i went to create my island i was shocked that all the decisions had been made and i was off to the island my wife created   i amissed out on all decisions and interactions that make animal crossing your own   i kind of feel robbed of getting to play the game like i wouldid as a kid   nintendo should seriously consider releasing a patch that at least allows you the option to have separate save files for separate accounts   to my knowledge all other games on the switch treat each account as a independent save file   please nintendo make this right  expand
1927,i love everything about this game except for the fact that it is limited to one island per game  this becomes a pain when you are sharing with your family  nintendo  i have been playing your games for as long as i can remember  but unfortunately my experience with animal crossing  new horizons has been completely ruined because of your one business move  not everyone has the time and moneyi love everything about this game except for the fact that it is limited to one island per game  this becomes a pain when you are sharing with your family  nintendo  i have been playing your games for as long as i can remember  but unfortunately my experience with animal crossing  new horizons has been completely ruined because of your one business move  not everyone has the time and money to buy multiple consoles for a single game  please  nintendo  allow users on the same switch to have different islands  i would happily change my rating to a 10 if this were the case  your goal should be to keep the entire community happy  expand
1928,as others have said  unplayable and absolutely terrible multiplayer   we have 3 young kids  and the level of frustration is enormous   until this is fixed  if you are buying for a family with multiple kids  you must avoid at all costs 
1929,horrible for poor kids  me and my little brother share a switch  technically mine  i paid for it and all the games  he uses it when i am at work or sleeping  i heard of animal crossing though a friend  said it was a calm way to spend quarantine  never played before  but the hype got me excited  i wouldid not know what to expect   i have not played before i played for about in hour or two then lethorrible for poor kids  me and my little brother share a switch  technically mine  i paid for it and all the games  he uses it when i am at work or sleeping  i heard of animal crossing though a friend  said it was a calm way to spend quarantine  never played before  but the hype got me excited  i wouldid not know what to expect   i have not played before i played for about in hour or two then let my bro on  only to see he could not play  69  dollars and a second person could not even play  i cannot get another switch and a second copy  i get my stuff with a part time job  and my brother is only 11   my parents have jobs that get them though paycheck to paycheck so asking them to lay down 400  dollars is ridiculous  obviously nintendo does not care for their poor families  if i knew this is nothe way the game functioned i would have saved my money  expand
1930,we are 3 people in this family who wants to play this game with our own islands  now nintendo demands us to buy one console each to be able to do so  i love nintendo and have supported them for 25 years  but this was a big blow 
1931,made an account just to give this game a a glowing review  i am not a person that usually even plays video games but i went out and bought a switch just play animal crossing and i could not be more happy with the gameplay i am excited to wake up every morning and see what s changed on the island
1932,if you exist then you need this game  there are some minor issues  like the hourly music not being unlocked for a while  but it is nothe most relaxing and wholesome game you will ever play  tbh i have never played the previous titles  so i wouldo not have any other games to compare it to  but from what i have played it is amazing 
1933,amazing game  new horizons perfectly embodies the  animal crossing franchise 
1934,ignore bad reviews  the 1 island thing really isn t an issue  appears to be just a bunch of people new to the franchise and gaming in general who do not understand whats going on 
1935,16 notas sobre 100debe dolerles mucho el éxito de este juego a los haters  eso sí  me encanta verlos sufrir qué culpa tiene nintendo si hace juego ganadores  están ofendidos porque re 3 remake resultó ser un juego de nota 8 sigan llorando jajajaja
1936,really spectacular game  lots of detail and charm  perfect for relaxing  the hourly music is so nice 
1937,as a new nintendo player and animal crossing player  this 1 player progression fundamentally kills the experience without any forewarning to let you know  waste of many that will be getting refunded  never again nintendo 
1938,i bought this game  looking forward to sharing a beloved franchise with my kids   i am deeply disappointed only the first profile to play gets a a game   everyone else gets to be a second class tourist   multiple profiles have to share that island  and only the primary player cannotravel to deserted islands  make building decisions  and things like that   instead of experiencing ai bought this game  looking forward to sharing a beloved franchise with my kids   i am deeply disappointed only the first profile to play gets a a game   everyone else gets to be a second class tourist   multiple profiles have to share that island  and only the primary player cannotravel to deserted islands  make building decisions  and things like that   instead of experiencing a beloved franchise  i have kids fighting over who gets to dig up fossils  collect the seashells for income  etc etc   the decision not to have separate islands for separate profiles is a decision that s baffling  cold hearted  and bringing conflict to my household  expand
1939,no nintendo just no  nintendo you have to realize that families do not have multiple switches the switch is a family console and you wouldecided to make it 1  island per switch  nobody is gonna buy a new switch just to have another island  the game was meant to be an island for you and only you you should not expect people to receive this well  i have a sibling and we were ecstatic when we gotno nintendo just no  nintendo you have to realize that families do not have multiple switches the switch is a family console and you wouldecided to make it 1  island per switch  nobody is gonna buy a new switch just to have another island  the game was meant to be an island for you and only you you should not expect people to receive this well  i have a sibling and we were ecstatic when we got this game  we got this game for primarily my sister but i was also ready to make my own island until i realized that me and my sister would have to share a island now at first i was okay with this but then it iset in that if i was the leader my sister could not pick up a branch  nintendo please fix this  you will be praised if you will  expand
1940,player 2 limitations ruin the entire experience  definitely regret buying this one
1941,i own the nintendo switch in our house but bought the game for my girlfriend to play  i also want to play this game but realised very quickly that my animal crossing experience was stunted  as my island was a carbon copy of my girlfriend s island that she d been working on for the past week  all the major decisions so far in the game have already been made for me and i literally do noti own the nintendo switch in our house but bought the game for my girlfriend to play  i also want to play this game but realised very quickly that my animal crossing experience was stunted  as my island was a carbon copy of my girlfriend s island that she d been working on for the past week  all the major decisions so far in the game have already been made for me and i literally do not have the power to do any more i cannot help but think it would ve been easier for the game devs to make it iso we had our own individual islands in the first place instead of implementing this stupid shared island feature that literally no one asked for  at this point in time it is impossible for me to play this game  expand
1942,the best animal crossing game ever  i ll be playing for months online is bad but that s nintendo  they re afraid of the internet a lot of love and care put into the development of this game  watch and learn  gamefreak 
1943,i have 4 kids  3 of which play this game  with only a single island per switch this has become a disappointment among the children  one child has unlocked most of the items on the island and the other ones were disappointed about that  whoever is on first gets to collect the resources on the home island for the day  i am disappointed with how the game makers decided to do this when thei have 4 kids  3 of which play this game  with only a single island per switch this has become a disappointment among the children  one child has unlocked most of the items on the island and the other ones were disappointed about that  whoever is on first gets to collect the resources on the home island for the day  i am disappointed with how the game makers decided to do this when the switch handles profiles so well compared to previous nintendo products  all other games that my kids have played have also handled profiles and separation of those profiles well also  this is why i feel that this deserves a very low score  i hope they find a fix for this  expand
1944,frankly i am disappointed in nintendo  i am new to animal crossing i have no experience with previous games  however all that being said it is a good game  i has good graphics but it is lacking on a few points  first one island per switch is insane  i have two sisters  my family can not afford 3 switches so we cannot all play a 60  game  next  the game functions in real time in some waysfrankly i am disappointed in nintendo  i am new to animal crossing i have no experience with previous games  however all that being said it is a good game  i has good graphics but it is lacking on a few points  first one island per switch is insane  i have two sisters  my family can not afford 3 switches so we cannot all play a 60  game  next  the game functions in real time in some ways that s awesome things rely on time of day  but also i am a student who cannot log on all day so i amiss certain fish and bugs  with it running in real time it takes real days for jobs to be completed  for example you place the lot for a house after 5am the following morning it will be built  the only real story to the game is improving your house and island  all other aspects are a gathering aspect  as in find resources  when improving your house you wouldo not get to pick new roof or bigger room it is a set order each becoming more and more expensive  i understand teaching the player responsibility but playing the game the proper way without exploits  like tarantulas  makes a 2 5 million  bells loan unrealistic  with loans and things you pick what they are for  i am also loosing interest because after playing for a week i am still stuck with an island i cannot customize  i have great plans for what i want but no way to do them  i thought i was buying a game i could sit and play for hours but i wouldo not see how that is possible when i cannot do anything  i fish and catch bugs with hopes of paying my crazy house loans and for what  weeks upon weeks before i can do what i wouldesire  maybe think twice about purchasing it is definitely not worth the hype  expand
1945,i have never played an animal crossing game before  but i was really looking forward to this one given the hype and the fact that my partner is a huge fan of the series  however  after purchasing the game for au 80 i realise i cannot actually play this game properly as a non primary account i am honestly baffled at this decision by the developers  i amean i am happy to buy a new copy ofi have never played an animal crossing game before  but i was really looking forward to this one given the hype and the fact that my partner is a huge fan of the series  however  after purchasing the game for au 80 i realise i cannot actually play this game properly as a non primary account i am honestly baffled at this decision by the developers  i amean i am happy to buy a new copy of the game if it means that i can enjoy the full experience myself  but this is not even an option  i actually have to buy a whole new copy and a new switch as well  this move is worse than anything ea has done with its micro transactions in my opinion  what a way to sell more switch consoles  it is either genius or disgusting  for those who have money  it is probably the former  but i for one have lost a lot of respect for nintendo given that i cannot even experience the game for what it really is  and that my switch console is forever barred from animal crossing  unless i wouldelete my partner s save  i have to give this a 0 10  expand

1948,i have almost no issue with this game only the fact that the crafting system could have been better  like using your storage when you craft in the house and multi crafting but other wise i fully enjoy it  while the one island thing does not affect me i can see the issues with it i wouldo hope nintendo also patches it iso the islands feel more sharable for a family or couple 
1949,i feel this game is a little underwhelming for my taste  i love the characters and the noises  but the story is a little boring  but i like more action based games then pulling weeds and fishing  so who am i too say  it is just my opinion  i would still get

1977,i love backwards games design  like not being able to have my own separate island or playing coop and being a glorified spectator 
1978,only one save per console  this is ruining the game for us  the switch is a family console  we share it and it is connected the the lounge tv we started playing this game together after getting it for my six year old daughter  progress is notied to her account and progress for everyone else is dependant on what she does   kids do not understand this mechanic and they should not have to only one save per console  this is ruining the game for us  the switch is a family console  we share it and it is connected the the lounge tv we started playing this game together after getting it for my six year old daughter  progress is notied to her account and progress for everyone else is dependant on what she does   kids do not understand this mechanic and they should not have to so my daughter has unlocked  with some help from me  the the part where you build the bridge followed by three new houses   there is a lot of grinding for resources and crafting required for this   but the other players cannot even help out by contributing materials or even getting the recipes for the items that need to be crafted   we are just passengers and the whole experience feels cheap and empty this is nototally unnecessary design   shame on you  nintendo  expand
1979,one of the many super annoyed people at the first person to play the game is nothe only one who can progress it  when you kindly let your child play first you are stuck with them as the island representative  we are getting bored already of this and i am nothing but disappointed at nintendo for screwing us over like this 
1980,this game is phenomenal  it is amazing  the graphics are great and there is an amazing amount of detail  i love the vibe this game gives off  now to all the people putting 1 3 because  they were the second player and there was not a second island for you to make  how   stupid are you  when has the ever been an animal crossing game were there were multiple towns for different save files this game is phenomenal  it is amazing  the graphics are great and there is an amazing amount of detail  i love the vibe this game gives off  now to all the people putting 1 3 because  they were the second player and there was not a second island for you to make  how   stupid are you  when has the ever been an animal crossing game were there were multiple towns for different save files  like seriously  maybe you should do your research before   about a good game that you had no idea what you were doing  expand
1981,if you have a family of kids who might have some interest in playing this game and you wouldo not have enough switch consoles for each of them to have their own island  you may want to reconsider your purchase to avoid family feuds  currently sharing with 4 family members  5th one pending  and while this game is fun for a solo player with your own island  once you have new players move in  youif you have a family of kids who might have some interest in playing this game and you wouldo not have enough switch consoles for each of them to have their own island  you may want to reconsider your purchase to avoid family feuds  currently sharing with 4 family members  5th one pending  and while this game is fun for a solo player with your own island  once you have new players move in  you have to share  or force others to share  limited resources  creative space  argue over plots of land  villagers and landscaping decisions  you have to greatly modify your play in order to accommodate for others on your island  which may be fun in some cases  co op with your so  but with kids others who will ruin things or do not care about sharing  your game experience is significantly reduced  only the first player gets the special missions rewards and any additional profile that moves in to the island is left in the dark as far as instructions and introductions and additional perks  for  60 you get to fight over who gets to play first in the day to get the limited resources of the island  and for the small cost of another console  you can have a separate island for a second player  in the past you can easily have extra game cartridges memory files for new islands but now you have to buy a whole additional console  with 7 players in the house  we do pretty good with sharing the switch so we know we do not need a second one  so why would you force your players to have a second console for another island  this is outrageous of the game developers  and i will not condone this behavior by big companies who already have a lot of money to begin with  i refuse to patronize nintendo and animal crossing any further because of their apparent and disgusting greed  expand
1982,you are searching something to play during coronavirus  certainly this is not the game you want to play during this period this is nothe most boring game i ever played  if you are searching something new  maybe you just buyed a new switch  this is not the game you want to buy if you are not interested in life simulation  creativity or virtual friendship dont buy this game  dont even tryyou are searching something to play during coronavirus  certainly this is not the game you want to play during this period this is nothe most boring game i ever played  if you are searching something new  maybe you just buyed a new switch  this is not the game you want to buy if you are not interested in life simulation  creativity or virtual friendship dont buy this game  dont even try it worst 50  spent i prefer to play fortnite instead of this sh  t  expand
1983,this game straight up sucks nards  one island per a switch was bs now i just found out if you want to move a building slightly over from where you put it you have to pay 50000 bells to move it to a entirely new spot and then wait a day then pay an additional 50000 bells to move it where you wanted and wait another full day thats straight up retarded like wtf
1984,this game has a lot of charm and it can be fun  but it is absolutely dull if you want to play local multi player  the second and following players lack the same decision making as the first player  also you cannot have more than one island per console when sharing a console in a household having to buy another console just to play one game is idiotic 
1985,bought this game for having a relaxing time  unfortunately the game stress the heck out of you for the wrong reasons no cloud save only one island per switch and only one normal player per switch kinda not relaxing when all my progress is in jeopardy and cant even have someone fully share the experience no buyable baits nearly impossible to catch special fishesbought this game for having a relaxing time  unfortunately the game stress the heck out of you for the wrong reasons no cloud save only one island per switch and only one normal player per switch kinda not relaxing when all my progress is in jeopardy and cant even have someone fully share the experience no buyable baits nearly impossible to catch special fishes unneccessary unskippable dialogue for every little thing yeah it is the 10000 fish i take or the 10000 bait i amade  stop wasting my time everything is geared upon making you waste time  turning an adorable and relaxing experience in a neverending and frustrating series of chores  i am sorry  i really would like to love this game  but to me it is obvious that more testing  more qol measures and a more modern approach would have been way better and needed for the masterpiece we were really waiting for and ffs it is a single palyer game  leave us play how we want  expand
1986,juego que puede llegar a ser a veces divertido pero que carece de contenido
1987,this is nothe first animal crossing i have ever played  i love similar games so i thought i will give this a try  however  it is not as funs as i had hoped the game has a lot of charm and give me that relaxing and laid back feeling that i was looking for  though it isomehow feels a little lackluster  it istats out very slow and progressively gets better  but it never reaches a high enoughthis is nothe first animal crossing i have ever played  i love similar games so i thought i will give this a try  however  it is not as funs as i had hoped the game has a lot of charm and give me that relaxing and laid back feeling that i was looking for  though it isomehow feels a little lackluster  it istats out very slow and progressively gets better  but it never reaches a high enough point that i feel drawn to it  most things get repetitive fast and it does not feel as rewarding as i would like  it is also to simple for my taste  both when it comes to difficulty and depth i still play it for a few minutes every day  though it does not provide as much enjoyment compared to other games  i wouldo not regret the purchase  but it is not a game i would recommend to likeminded individuals  however  i can see how it can be enjoyable to some people  expand
1988,just as other reviewers are stating  good game  however  the multiplayer aspect island limit makes it unplayable for me  so started the game and due to lockdown has been progressing without me  so by the time i get back into the game i wouldo not think i ll care to play  very disappointed 
1989,some seriously questionable mechanics   like for example  in order to play online so your friends can visit your island  you have to enter the airport  sit through the same dialog text  tell the npc at the counter to open your island for visitors  wait while the game saves and shows a  connecting to internet  screen for 10 secs   then the island will be open for visitors the problemsome seriously questionable mechanics   like for example  in order to play online so your friends can visit your island  you have to enter the airport  sit through the same dialog text  tell the npc at the counter to open your island for visitors  wait while the game saves and shows a  connecting to internet  screen for 10 secs   then the island will be open for visitors the problem is  if you want to do practically anything in the game  send a letter  turn in the daily ghost quest  etc  you have to go back to that npc  turn off online play  sitting through the same text and screens  just to do that action   then you have to travel back once you ve done your thing  and re enable the island   it is just annoying  tedious  frustrating  and seemingly unnecessary   considering you are always online   case in point  friends cannotext you on your in game phone  they just cannot visit you   super dumb now lets say you want to have multiple people in the house play the game  and each person wants their own playthrough   cannot happen   the game will literally only let you have one playthrough per switch  and everyone has to share the same island   that means a family member can clean the whole island out  smash all the rocks  dig up all the fossils  etc  and when you wouldecide to play later  the island is picked clean   not to mention someone can advance the story  and you miss it   seriously not cool   we have 3 people in our family that play the switch  and only 1 can play animal crossing there are also gameplay mechanics that were badly implemented   for example  if you want to sell items  which is nothe only real way to make money  you have two choices  walk up to the store mailbox and sell the items  or  enter the store  wait for the load screen  talk to the store keeper and go through his dialogue  sell your items  leave the store  watch the loading screen again   the problem is you get 100  of the sell price of your items if you talk to the storekeep  but only like 60  of the price if you use the box on the outside of the store   they explain the outside box as a way to sell items whenever the store is closed  they are open 9am to 10pm daily  but at the penalty of changing you a heavy fee   i get why the outside hours box charges a fee  even if i think it is a stupid mechanic  but why are they charging me the fee when the store is still open   why must i sit through two loading screens and a dialogue tree just to vend my items at full price it is mechanics like this nothat really suck the fun out of the game  and turn it into a downright chore   the novelty of the cute load screens  or crafting animations  or lengthy repetitive dialogue really gets in the way of fun   also it loses 4 points outright for the dumb single island mechanic   bad job  nintendo  expand
1990,my son and daughter have always lovedanimal crossing  they were thrilled that new horizons was coming out and that we could all play together  the game is great for 1 player  the graphics and play ability is awesome  it istinks for multi player  as the second or third player you cannot really do anything but walk behind player one  you have no value and do not add to the gameplay  i wouldmy son and daughter have always lovedanimal crossing  they were thrilled that new horizons was coming out and that we could all play together  the game is great for 1 player  the graphics and play ability is awesome  it istinks for multi player  as the second or third player you cannot really do anything but walk behind player one  you have no value and do not add to the gameplay  i would love to see a split iscreen option or where each player can have the same gameplay as the creator of the island  expand
1991,oh nintendo  you areally screwed this one up one island per switch is a dreadful decision  what about a typical family with a couple of kids who can only afford one console and share  absolutely wrecked this game for a lot of people  unless of course you are player 1  then i am sure you will have a great time 
1992,got this game for my whole family in hope that everyone could have the same enjoyment i had with animal crossing when i was younger  i am required to share an island with my 8 year old sister who takes all of the resources and messes with my house on the daily  this game does not deserve better rating than this due to the lack of concern for players using the same switch  limiting 1 islandgot this game for my whole family in hope that everyone could have the same enjoyment i had with animal crossing when i was younger  i am required to share an island with my 8 year old sister who takes all of the resources and messes with my house on the daily  this game does not deserve better rating than this due to the lack of concern for players using the same switch  limiting 1 island per switch might be the worst desighn idea that i have ever seen from nintendo  expand
1993,i was not even planning on getting this game  but they have improved the series so much with this iteration that i picked it up anyways  now i spend at least a few hours a day on my island  one of the biggest improvements i have found is nothat it iseems that item randomization in the shops and from balloon gifts seems to be more tailored to your purchases that you have already made in the game i was not even planning on getting this game  but they have improved the series so much with this iteration that i picked it up anyways  now i spend at least a few hours a day on my island  one of the biggest improvements i have found is nothat it iseems that item randomization in the shops and from balloon gifts seems to be more tailored to your purchases that you have already made in the game  so you are more likely to get items that match the aesthetic or set that you are trying to pull together for your house  maybe i have just gotten lucky  but when i got the game i noticed a lot of other people had really tightly designed spaces that looked great already despite how new the game is  in previous titles i had little incentive to upgrade my house for a while because of how hard it was to get the furniture and items i wanted in the store  now i am already grinding bells to get more space  the crafting and customization mechanics are also a great improvement  and while tools that break can be a pain  it is a lot less painful to have to drop a flimsy tool to make room for resources than the normal tools in other games  i cannot wait to see what else acnh has in store  and what will come with new content  expand
1994,i see that most of the bad reviews are of the multiplayer aspect of the game and i can understand where they are coming from however  this game has been fun as hell for me and im going to rate on my own personal experience the game is a fun time and ultimately relaxing  it came out at the perfect time 
1995,such a wonderful game  i wouldo not play animal crossing for the multiplayer  my wife and i have our own switches and have tons of fun visiting each other s islands and trading different things we have found for each other  i highly recommend this game  do not trust the salty reviews 
1996,it is sh t that you cannot have your own island if you share a switch      
1997,one island per console is just too greedy even for ninteando  until this gets fixed i cannot rate it any higher 
1998,one island per console  greedy and unfair  an anti consumer practice and is disappointing to say the least
1999,one island per console that is plain stupid  it is a move my nintendo for you to buy more consoles  the saddest thing of all is nothat it is working 
2000,very sad to find out the second player is like a slave for the first player  i have to stop playing until this gets fixed 
2001,do not buy this game  it is a scam it is a total scam  only 1 player in your house gets to actually play the game  seriously  even if you have multiple cartrages  only the first player to start an island gets their own island  evergone else who joins later becomes a guest on that players island  only that player gets to place  buildings and progress the game the only way for everyonedo not buy this game  it is a scam it is a total scam  only 1 player in your house gets to actually play the game  seriously  even if you have multiple cartrages  only the first player to start an island gets their own island  evergone else who joins later becomes a guest on that players island  only that player gets to place  buildings and progress the game the only way for everyone in your house to enjoy the full game is noto caugh up an extra   300 per person for individual consoles  there needs to be a mass boycott of this game and its design studio until they fix this outrageous travesty  expand
2002,giving a zero star review because i have never played this game  i own a switch console with my roommates  i was thinking about buying new horizons  but my roommate bought it first and started a file  i sat down to start my own file and then we arealized the game s terrible multiplayer situation  she did not exactly want me to play on her file  and i wouldid not want to have to intrude on her game giving a zero star review because i have never played this game  i own a switch console with my roommates  i was thinking about buying new horizons  but my roommate bought it first and started a file  i sat down to start my own file and then we arealized the game s terrible multiplayer situation  she did not exactly want me to play on her file  and i wouldid not want to have to intrude on her game  furthermore  i want to have the whole experience of the game as someone who has never played an animal crossing game before  there is nothing i can do to have my own file except to buy an entire new console and game  somehow  i wouldo not think animal crossing  new horizons will be worth a  360 price tag it is completely ridiculous that breath of the wild  a massive open world game that takes up 14g of storage and is one of the most popular releases for the system  as well as every other game  was able to find a way to allow for multiple save files for different users but animal crossing could not  we talked to nintendo s support about the problem and they mentioned that the single file system was to maintain the game s artistic integrity  well  nintendo  thanks to all that integrity  i cannot play this game  i hope they release an update to fix the save file issue because i really would like to experience this game  expand
2003,this is my first animal crossing game  generally  i wouldo not like these types of games  but i wouldo not understand what exactly it is about this game  but i cannot stop playing 
2004,a relaxing game with a lot of stuff to do  would never getting bored of this game 
2005,this game is notruly fantastic  the only reason i cannot feel okay with giving it a 10 10 is because of a lack of a mass craft feature  turning 30 clams into fish bait 1 by one can be very tedious  so if they made an update that allowed you to craft multiple at one time  it would be a perfect game and easily a contender for goty 
2006,this game is notoo fun   think i amight be addicted  with everything going on right now this game provides a great escape  if you want to get into the animal crossing series play this one  you will not be disappointed 
2007,reggie really outdid himself this notime it is fun it is really fun 10 5 cannot wait for the sequel
2008,i cannot believe we need two switch for a full game experience  i find okay the one island per console  but at least give both players the same opportunities  i can only hope this noto change so i can finally play this game at 100   
2009,i was so excited for this but limiting the game to one island per switch has ruined this experience for me 
2010,이 게임이 91점 게임인지 알수있는 게임 이다 
2011,update  we just unlocked terraforming  and it looks like this is another feature that player 2 misses out on  i wouldo not even care that i share an island with my bf  but the fact i cannot make any impactful changes to how the island looks sucks   i was really looking forward to creating a beautiful island but all i can do is plant flowers   trees  i cannot make pathways  bridges or terraform atupdate  we just unlocked terraforming  and it looks like this is another feature that player 2 misses out on  i wouldo not even care that i share an island with my bf  but the fact i cannot make any impactful changes to how the island looks sucks   i was really looking forward to creating a beautiful island but all i can do is plant flowers   trees  i cannot make pathways  bridges or terraform at all  i cannot understand why nintendo has done this like many others here  i am really disappointed by the restrictions of player 2  any player that isn t the founder  me and my bf got this game to play together but soon found out player 2 cannot make any executive decisions  does not have access to any of the quests  cannot place buildings infrastructure  and ultimately misses out on a lot of the story  this sucks  it means one of us misses out on the full experience of the game  this is unfortunately not rectified by the option for co op play  which is just a joke  co op works by having one  leader  that can play as normal  and then the  followers  the followers cannot access their tool wheel  inventory or leave the same screen as the leader  which just results in really boring gameplay  the follower is just essentially reduced to being a pack mule for the leader  and unable to really contribute in any way  as it takes so long to cycle through your tools to really be able to do anything  it isucks because it would ve been so fun to play together co op  but nintendo really missed the mark with these limitations  the only work around is noto get a new switch and second copy of the game  which is ridiculous  it is such a shame because playing the game solo has been really great  but the fact that you have to buy multiple consoles for everyone to get the full experience of the game is just terrible  and for that i cannot justify giving this game a good rating  expand
2012,i am saddened by this game  i was incredibly excited to play  and seeing that there would be couch co op i was even more excited since i could share the experience with my fiance  but  i was disappointed  there is a one island per console rule and player one has all the control  all materials are shared between players so if you chop up all the wood  hit all the rocks  and dig up anythingi am saddened by this game  i was incredibly excited to play  and seeing that there would be couch co op i was even more excited since i could share the experience with my fiance  but  i was disappointed  there is a one island per console rule and player one has all the control  all materials are shared between players so if you chop up all the wood  hit all the rocks  and dig up anything from the ground  there will be nothing left for player two  your best bet is noto try and save up miles and visit a mystery island  which is annoying as hell  player two cannot help build homes and you cannot trade bugs fish between players either  this all has been very frustrating since my fiance hasn t had much fun playing alongside me  the game itself has some odd mechanics too  fishing and digging are hard as hell  there is no indicator that you are facing the right direction so most of the time you end up missing your target  crafting items is a   and a half  if you want to craft multiple items  you have to click to craft  watch the animation  then click back in to craft again  repeat until you build as many items as you want  super time consuming and annoying  all tools will break eventually  and i wish there was a durability indicator so you are aware when it will break  i wouldo enjoy this game while playing alone  but it is a real bummer that we cannot have our own separate islands and have equal participation  if that gets fixed and the other minor things change  i ll be happy with the game  but for now  i am disappointed  expand
2013,my boyfriend and i went halfsies on the game only to realise that one of us would not even really get to play it properly  pretty lousy of nintendo   cannot imagine 7 people happily being side characters in someone else s game as their only experience  i wouldeleted my saves and let him have it isince he s more excited to play  what a waste of my money 
2014,bought to play with my girlfriend  never gotta happen i guess   one island per console 
2015,animal crossing new horizons is nothe best game i have played on my switch after breath of the wild  it is that good however this game is not for everyone  if you like fast paced games do not even bother  this game was not made for a marathon  it is a simulation game  it is kind of a mix between the best of minecraft and the best of the sims yes  there is nothe problem of only one island peranimal crossing new horizons is nothe best game i have played on my switch after breath of the wild  it is that good however this game is not for everyone  if you like fast paced games do not even bother  this game was not made for a marathon  it is a simulation game  it is kind of a mix between the best of minecraft and the best of the sims yes  there is nothe problem of only one island per console  but honestly  i would buy one switch for every user just to play  expand
2016,i bought the game and i share my switch with my brother  i let him start the game and when i was about to play i realized i could only play on his island and do basically nothing  i bought the game and the console and i cannot actually play the game so  only solution is noto kindly ask my brother to delete all his save for me to really be able to play the game  he s been playing fori bought the game and i share my switch with my brother  i let him start the game and when i was about to play i realized i could only play on his island and do basically nothing  i bought the game and the console and i cannot actually play the game so  only solution is noto kindly ask my brother to delete all his save for me to really be able to play the game  he s been playing for several days so i understand it can also be frustrating for him not having in consideration this huge issue  the game seems quite nice and enjoyable  but i find it really too important to just let it pass  that s why i give this low rate  i really expect nintendo to fix this issue and let different account on the same console to run their own island  if they do so  i will consider remaking this review according to the actual quality of the game itself  expand

2025,my brother was first to play on our switch  while he s far ahead of everyone else  meaning no story blocks for me or my sister  i am still a little mad that i am limited to playing on a single island and not my own  on my profile  other caveats with the multiplayer make it impossible for me to enjoy the game  shown by the fact that when i play i cannot even play for more than 10 minutes a daymy brother was first to play on our switch  while he s far ahead of everyone else  meaning no story blocks for me or my sister  i am still a little mad that i am limited to playing on a single island and not my own  on my profile  other caveats with the multiplayer make it impossible for me to enjoy the game  shown by the fact that when i play i cannot even play for more than 10 minutes a day without getting bored  such as the limited daily resources for all players  expand
2026,its animal crossing but the multiplayer isn t good  other than that it is great 
2027,while being a first time i played this series while enjoying it  i can say that this was a good game to start with  but the 1 island a switch thing throws many people off so i am not giving it a10 10 but this is still a good game 
2028,one island for the console    only one  it is just some kind of nightmare  i paid 60   and they put some other restrictions on me  as if i wouldownloaded the demo   shame on nintendo  i hope this decision will be reviewed as soon as possible 
2029,one island is not enough  why would you make it to where i can only have one island when i have a full household of people wanting to play  fix this now 
2030,only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff  the other players on the island cannot contribute and can only really gather resources  i hope nintendo fixes this 
2031,the entire point of the game is noto create a community on one shared island  and you can never do that because only the first player created in the game can actually be a part of it  even if you play 1 player at a time  i cannot help my girlfriend  because only her can make the story go on  it is just like i am living here as a weird hermit who does not want to be a part of the community the entire point of the game is noto create a community on one shared island  and you can never do that because only the first player created in the game can actually be a part of it  even if you play 1 player at a time  i cannot help my girlfriend  because only her can make the story go on  it is just like i am living here as a weird hermit who does not want to be a part of the community  huge disappointment i recommend you wouldo not buy this game unless you want to play it isolo and not with your family on the same switch this being said  the game suffers many other inconviniences even when you play solo  lack of mass craft or mass buy  you have to craft things one by one  hello clams  i hate you  for example  expand
2032,there are 4 of us second citizens how very strict limitation in terms of gameplay  cannot donate bug  do not participate in island big decisions i cannot even create my own island  this limitation is not disclosed beforehand  and that is nothe worst part  i play several hours before realizing it  now i have only the following choices  stay second class citizen  wait for a patch there are 4 of us second citizens how very strict limitation in terms of gameplay  cannot donate bug  do not participate in island big decisions i cannot even create my own island  this limitation is not disclosed beforehand  and that is nothe worst part  i play several hours before realizing it  now i have only the following choices  stay second class citizen  wait for a patch  bug another swith   game all suck i wouldo not recommend this game for a household  or make sure to select the right person as main citizen  expand
2033,watched my sister play this all week while working from home only to find out i cannot enjoy the game anywhere near as much as she is  main reasons being that i cannot have my own island  make any major infrastructure decisions  or even get the same special missions just because we both use the same switch  this was a terrible idea masked as being a  feature 
2034,the game does not deserve a zero  however  there is a major flaw with the way multiplayer is handled  i wouldo not speak for everyone but nintendo must see that the majority of us have the same complaint  why must we aresort to purchasing a separate nintendo switch or switch lite just to have an individual untainted island to experience on our own yes  the game is based around playing withthe game does not deserve a zero  however  there is a major flaw with the way multiplayer is handled  i wouldo not speak for everyone but nintendo must see that the majority of us have the same complaint  why must we aresort to purchasing a separate nintendo switch or switch lite just to have an individual untainted island to experience on our own yes  the game is based around playing with friends but it can cause more harm than good when no one gets to do what they want on the game  everyone keeps getting popped to the leader while they are running their own errands  and all of the resources are hogged by the early bird  this is completely absurd and needs to be fixed  i cannot imagine that it is notoo hard to allow individual save files of this game  come on nintendo  expand
2035,would be 10  if i was the only one in my home that wanted to play it would be  but the single save file blows major ass 
2036,fabulous game  but the blatant attempt to get people to buy more consoles with the one island per system is disturbing  especially when the switch is all about how shareable and multiplayer it is   when you take time to think about reasons why it could only be this way  1 island per  there is none besides to boost sales   there is no way they do not have the capability to make it morefabulous game  but the blatant attempt to get people to buy more consoles with the one island per system is disturbing  especially when the switch is all about how shareable and multiplayer it is   when you take time to think about reasons why it could only be this way  1 island per  there is none besides to boost sales   there is no way they do not have the capability to make it more than one island   i am just glad i have not heard an excuse like it is to encourage family bonding or something   they purposefully downgraded this game  expand
2037,the one island per switch rule is noterrible and a horrible money grabby thing to do  please fix this 
2038,give us multiple islands per switch i want to play the game too second player just feels like a meaningless grind  very unhappy with this game 
2039,absolute turd game design  why does only the first player get the full game experience  i wouldo not mind 1 island per console  every animal crossing has done that  it makes the game more interesting to indirectly interact with the other people in your household playing the game  what s inexcusable is nothat only the first player can advance the game forward 
2040,the game only allows one island per console  not account  and thus i have to play as a glorified npc on my partner s island  not cool nintendo 
2041,wonderful game  except that same console multiplayer is really broken  i wanted to build an island together with my wife  but only the first player can meaningfully contribute to and progress through the island development  the second player does not get the storyline recipes  quests  or really anything to do on their own regarding the growth of the island  very disappointing 
2042,game is decent but you can only have one island per console which limits others that wanna play on another account 
2043,animal crossing wild world is probably the game i have put the most hours into of all games  i was definitely thrilled for this game  however it is really disappointing that not all players get to have the full experience  hoping nintendo patches this  or at the very least  does not do this again for the next ac game  this was a huge disappointment that ruins what had the potential to be aanimal crossing wild world is probably the game i have put the most hours into of all games  i was definitely thrilled for this game  however it is really disappointing that not all players get to have the full experience  hoping nintendo patches this  or at the very least  does not do this again for the next ac game  this was a huge disappointment that ruins what had the potential to be a great family game  expand
2044,inconsiderate game design for families while specially being designed on a console for families  this game is nearly unplayable as a second player  i share my game with my brother who rarely plays which haunts all progression  and he cannot manage deleting his character  i am the one who owns the switch which makes this even harder  as i cannot even buy a new game or a new account for this game 
2045,the game is amazing  ignore the whiney little babies crying about islands and rating it 0  sure  it would be nice to be able to have multiple islands  but this does not make an amazing game 0 10  they are idiots  the game is great 
2046,nintendo  hey  listen yes  like navi  the fairy your one switch rule is more much annoying than navi  the multiplayer restrictions are   nearly   equally annoying  exploiting your passionate fan base erodes the brand   it makes me sad  you are not supposed to be like the other guys 
2047,i am going to be completely honest  the game actually looks great  the graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i cannotell however we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all  is in fact the one island per console limit  what this means is nothat if you have a family household nintendo switch  you all have to share 1 island  and if you want another i am going to be completely honest  the game actually looks great  the graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i cannotell however we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all  is in fact the one island per console limit  what this means is nothat if you have a family household nintendo switch  you all have to share 1 island  and if you want another  you have to pay another 350  bucks  so essentially what happens is if you have switch being shared with multiple people  new islands are behind a 350  paywall  this is clearly nintendo s way of stealing money out of pure greed  please do not fall for this notrap  and save your dignity now although the problem is still there  it could still be semi fixed with a co op run island  however this is not the case  the account who created the island practically dictates all the major decisions  everyone else is a resident or more properly called the working class who literally does nothing other than doing what the person who created island has already completed and to top it all off of this crap cake is nothe fact that you cannot back up cloud saves  which means if something happens  that s too bad if you are one person who owns the console  then congrats and feel blessed  if you are a family then do not buy this game  as it is a scam  expand
2048,bought this game for my wife s birthday to play together and i am very disappointed we cannot enjoy the game as equals  i was so excited about being able to play together on one island to collaborate and work together  however  as the second person to join i cannot contribute to building new shop or choosing their location  when playing local co op the controls for both players is reduced bought this game for my wife s birthday to play together and i am very disappointed we cannot enjoy the game as equals  i was so excited about being able to play together on one island to collaborate and work together  however  as the second person to join i cannot contribute to building new shop or choosing their location  when playing local co op the controls for both players is reduced  upgrades like item wheel cannot be used  opening your inventory interrupts the other player s actions  like pulling out their fishing line for no reason  the secondary player is notrapped in a little brother mode where they cannot even pick up items or leave the view of the leader player  shaking the controller to swap leaders is helpful but does not make up for how limited this mode is nothe game is very fun but as the second player i cannot enjoy the game fully  i hope that nintendo will either improve local co op by giving all switch users full island access  improving co op controls and  adding true split iscreen  or worst case scrapping one island all together and giving all users their own save file expecting couples to pay at minimum  560  2 switches  2 game copies  2 online subscriptions  and even more for larger families  for each person to fully be able to experience animal crossing and play together is just absolutely unacceptable and needs to be fixed  expand
2049,why is nothere a limit to only one island per switch  this is ridiculous  having to pay an exorbitant amount of money for another switch and game is beyond being rude to your customers  not to mention the fact that it is impossible to get your hands on a new switch because they re sold out everywhere  please consider changing this  nobody wants to play a game where all you wouldo is collectwhy is nothere a limit to only one island per switch  this is ridiculous  having to pay an exorbitant amount of money for another switch and game is beyond being rude to your customers  not to mention the fact that it is impossible to get your hands on a new switch because they re sold out everywhere  please consider changing this  nobody wants to play a game where all you wouldo is collect resources without being a part of the dialogue or events  your rating on here is notanking because of this one issue  please fix this for your customers or else we will not be customers anymore  expand

2051,lamentable que el segundo jugador esté tan limitado y no pueda ni aprender a fabricar el hacha  es una verguenza que un juego para disfrutar con tus hermanos  familia  amigos etc solo lo pueda jugar en condiciones 1 persona y para colmo no es precisamente barato  le doy un 0
2052,one island per console is rediculous  it is incredibly unfair for families with more than one kid  nobody cares if people cheat in animal crossing just say you want the money  this is such a discusting move  even tom nook is better than nintendo  better fix it isoon we are not taking any of this  
2053,ce jeu est une honte   plus ça va moins il y a de fonctionnalité   nintendo dois se réveillé sinon cette série vas mourir et ça sera bien fais  
2054,great game cute npcs and graphics who cares about sharing switch since i am rich enough to buy a new one for my family  lol

2056,as a diehard fan of the series  who s sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into them all  and who still plays the gamecube version almost daily since 2002  i am really disappointed with this one i am going to give objective reasons  followed by my subjective opinions afterward  so let us just get right into it 1  one town per switch  why  gamecube let you have a town per memory card as a diehard fan of the series  who s sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into them all  and who still plays the gamecube version almost daily since 2002  i am really disappointed with this one i am going to give objective reasons  followed by my subjective opinions afterward  so let us just get right into it 1  one town per switch  why  gamecube let you have a town per memory card  and that was almost 20 years ago  also  why is whoever founds the town  the one who can make the progress in the game 2  dialogue  it is common agreement in the fanbase that  every ac game after the original has gotten worse with villager dialogue  with new horizons  it is really hit rock bottom  one liners seem to be the most common response when talking to villagers  yesterday  one of mine said today was fun  four times in a row  are you actually serious  nintendo 3  furniture  where in the world are the themed furniture sets  the different series  the animal crossing games  lifeblood is its unique and themed furniture  yes  i am aware there are a few out there   rattan  imperial  cute   i amay be missing one or two others  but i wouldo not think so  at least not that i am aware of so far  and seasonal holiday sets do not count  because they re exclusive to those holidays and events  i am talking about run of the mill sets you could always hope to find at nook s  or receive from villagers  and so on  where is the modern series  classic  cabana  lovely  exotic  why am i seeing  for the most part  the same  or identical pieces of furniture rotated in my  upgraded  nook s cranny  it is all the same generic  non themed pieces with slight color variations   and this also applies to flooring and wallpaper  which seemed to be as generic as they possibly could be  are sets being added in later  if so  why  why could not they be included as part of the base game 4  house expansion  there is so much extensive customization in mostly all other aspects of new horizons  yet we have to upgrade our house in a rigid  set in stone order  why  i just wanted to have the expanded central room  with the 2nd floor and maybe basement later on  such was my surprise when i found out that i have to add a back room  then i have to pay it off and then i have to add the left room  then add the right room  then i could have the second floor  why  nintendo  in new leaf  we were given the option as to how we wanted to expand  and the second story was the first upgrade after expanding your main room  i wouldo not want side rooms  why cannot i upgrade my house how i want like in the other games  i need to know why you ve deliberately removed this subjective gripes1  very few patterns shirts from the other games  which have always been staples  we are still early into the year and gameplay  so i am sure they change with the seasons  but so far i have only seen the misty shirt and frog shirt  as far as staple clothing 2  totakeke songs should not be buyable from the terminal in the town hall  because it negates any real reason to listen to k k  play songs and get the airchecks from him  since you can just buy 7 different songs in a week  more  if you are a time traveler 3  where are the gyroids  another staple of the animal crossing series  completely absent  save for lloid  and he s not furniture so he does not count 4  art exhibit in the museum   why is it not in the game  art has been a collectible item in every ac game  yet not only can we not donate them to the museum  the exhibit does not exist  but we art pieces are not even in the game  not even paintings  why  i am sure they re going to be in some dlc down the road  but why were not they included in the base game i am gonna leave it at this  despite probably being able to think of a few more subjective points  in conclusion  this game is fun  it is very customizable for the most part  and there is lots of interesting things to do  but as an animal crossing game  it does not hold up  there was more to do  collect  buy  etc  20 years ago in the first game  than in new horizons nintendo  and i am not afraid to say this  half assed this game  it feels rushed and very incomplete  despite the fact that new leaf came out 7 years ago  wherein they had all that time to really make the most amazing animal crossing experience ever  they dropped the ball  and as a passionate lover of this series  i am extremely disappointed  and it makes me really sad to have to say that  not even two weeks after it came out  expand
2057,great gameplay  looks beautiful  and i love the calming nature of the game  however there are a few things that really bother me playing  one part are the birdcages  and this is because i know kids play this game  they are so small the birds cannot move  and while they are not real i know this isn t uncommon in real life  i wouldo not like to be nit picky but i would like if they could make angreat gameplay  looks beautiful  and i love the calming nature of the game  however there are a few things that really bother me playing  one part are the birdcages  and this is because i know kids play this game  they are so small the birds cannot move  and while they are not real i know this isn t uncommon in real life  i wouldo not like to be nit picky but i would like if they could make an updated size  so people do not normalize that sort of treatment  i think the same should apply to goldfish and betta fish  very common pets among young children  which is nothe target audience of the game  these fish are more often than not kept in the same conditions portrayed   and i believe while it is a game  they should still make an example for kids  expand

2060,multiple kids cannot play this at the same time in split iscreen on one tv one switch   absolutely unacceptable   now i have kids fighting over a shared resource for how expensive the switch and the nintendo online account and the game was not acceptable seriously this should allow two or three or four kids to play at the same time

2063,i started a new account just to rate this  i bought this for my kids to play on thier switch but apparently having a separate profiles isnt enough   they each have to have thier own switch nintendo has gone the way of ripping people and i will not be buying anything else from them
2064,this game is not a family game  because nintendo choose to limit to 1 island by switch  so  if you wouldo not have 1 switch and 1 game for each people in your house that want to play acnh   you cannot   because  only the first player that run the game could make the island progression   the other players are just there to help collecting resources  as if they were servants the angry pointthis game is not a family game  because nintendo choose to limit to 1 island by switch  so  if you wouldo not have 1 switch and 1 game for each people in your house that want to play acnh   you cannot   because  only the first player that run the game could make the island progression   the other players are just there to help collecting resources  as if they were servants the angry point is nothat nintendo says u can play with 3 players in local multiplayer but it is fake   it is not really a multiplayer game  you cannot even have splitter screen  so you must stay near the leader player i am very disappointed  i could not afford  and i wouldo not want to  buy 3 more switch and 3 more games to play with my wife and my daughters   expand
2065,a beautiful and very fun game  having an island per console is fine  if you are looking for a local cooperative game  play something else  as animal crossing was always intended to be an individual life simulator  the cooperative it is just an extra 
2066,i have 2 kids that were looking forward to play and as multiple reviewers mentioned   the game is limited to one island per switch  the second person can play  but they are not getting the full functionality and have limitation on quests etc  did not expect this bs from nintendo  this is pure greed and i will not spend another dollar on their product 
2067,it is a great game despite its flaws  the attention to detail  the music and the overall presentation is great  as are most of the gameplay mechanics  if you want two islands on the same switch  do not buy it  if you want a chilled out life sim then there is nothing else that comes close to it on the switch 
2068,game of all type of people  i am 34 and cannot stop playing this game  a lot of enjoy 
2069,good game  worth giving a 10 10  dont understand why this game has a 5 4 audience rating 
2070,cannot progress in the game because my wife started playing first and all game progress is notied to whoever plays first  holy crap dumb game design  hopefully will get patched with a fix as soon as possible 
2071,honestly i was waiting so long for this game and not being able to have separate islands for everyone playing on the switch kinda ruins it for everyone  will not be buying future ac games if they are like this  such a money scheme  the game was almost perfect 
2072,do not buy this game if you have more than one oerson in your bouae that plays what a crock of   bought this game for my daughter but wanted to try it out  we cannot have two islands  what genius made this decision  and the solution is  buy another switch  this needs to be fixed immediately  i would return the game if i could  i have been playing games since the original atari anddo not buy this game if you have more than one oerson in your bouae that plays what a crock of   bought this game for my daughter but wanted to try it out  we cannot have two islands  what genius made this decision  and the solution is  buy another switch  this needs to be fixed immediately  i would return the game if i could  i have been playing games since the original atari and this has to be one of the most selfish and idiotic decisions made by a gaming company  way to step up during a time people are stuck inside  expand

2076,why can i not buy a second copy of this game to use on my switch  i think this policy restriction should be revisited asap 
2077,great game for a single person using a single switch console  however  other users on the same console are extremely handicapped  additional console users cannot further the story and advance the island  it requires the primary user to do all of that alone  honestly  it feels like nintendo is punishing the customers who only own one copy of the console and game 
2078,i bought this game to play with my wife  i let her make the island and her profile first  not knowing this would virtually make the game unplayable for me  you can only have one island on the console  but for me that was not the maine issue as i wanted to share an island with my wife anyway  but letting her crew the island left me unable to advance the game in any way  i would really likei bought this game to play with my wife  i let her make the island and her profile first  not knowing this would virtually make the game unplayable for me  you can only have one island on the console  but for me that was not the maine issue as i wanted to share an island with my wife anyway  but letting her crew the island left me unable to advance the game in any way  i would really like a patch set allows a toggle switch or something that would allow other players to make advancement on the island as well  basically to get anything out of the game now i would have to buy a second switch and another copy of the game   expand
2079,i wouldo not understand the decision to limit the number of islands to one on the switch  if i want to experience the game for myself  my options are to delete my girlfriends island  or go purchase an additional switch and re purchase the game  i used to think ea and blizzard were bad  first time ever purchasing animal crossing  and unless fixed  i can guarantee this will be my last  do thei wouldo not understand the decision to limit the number of islands to one on the switch  if i want to experience the game for myself  my options are to delete my girlfriends island  or go purchase an additional switch and re purchase the game  i used to think ea and blizzard were bad  first time ever purchasing animal crossing  and unless fixed  i can guarantee this will be my last  do the right thing  at least bungie and bethesda communicated to their   rightfully   angry fan bases when their games were broken  unacceptable  this makes soldier 76 fallout look like game of the year  if you plan on playing this game with a live in partner  do not bother  absolute waste of money and player 2 s time  expand
2080,super beautiful and wonderful game for one person  same as many ppl  is very frustrating to spend money on a game that allows only one person per gaming console to fully enjoy and access lots of the game  super simple fix  so hope they can lose a bit of the greed 
2081,separate islands for each profile should be a given  i am not buying another switch just to have my own island  i am also not going to play on my kid s island because it is not my island  this limitation should be in bold print and all caps on the cover of this game so people know what they re walking into  nintendo will do nothing to address this and as a lifelong nintendo player it is crazyseparate islands for each profile should be a given  i am not buying another switch just to have my own island  i am also not going to play on my kid s island because it is not my island  this limitation should be in bold print and all caps on the cover of this game so people know what they re walking into  nintendo will do nothing to address this and as a lifelong nintendo player it is crazy frustrating  never looked at metacritic in my life  but heard this is where to go to vent  expand
2082,this could have been a great game if you simply could create more than one island  my sister got the whole family hyped for this great game without realizing no one could actually take any decisions  we could just follow her lead since we were not the first one to play on the device  for a game that prides itself on self discovery and the freedom to do what you want  there is very littlethis could have been a great game if you simply could create more than one island  my sister got the whole family hyped for this great game without realizing no one could actually take any decisions  we could just follow her lead since we were not the first one to play on the device  for a game that prides itself on self discovery and the freedom to do what you want  there is very little choice  the switch was conceived with groups and families in mind  why cannot every family member play their own way  most people do not have the money to just buy another switch and are now stuck having spent 80  on a game that not everyone can enjoy the same way  shameful  expand
2083,this game is a ridiculous cash grab by the corporate pigs named nintendo  they limit the islands to one per console  especially in this notrying time they are testing people and soon people will realize they are just using them for money  i thought nintendo was better than this  i would expect such behavior out of ea but nintendo is worse than ea because they are costing us  300 dollarsthis game is a ridiculous cash grab by the corporate pigs named nintendo  they limit the islands to one per console  especially in this notrying time they are testing people and soon people will realize they are just using them for money  i thought nintendo was better than this  i would expect such behavior out of ea but nintendo is worse than ea because they are costing us  300 dollars minimum each for people who do not own a switch   300 is nothe price of a switch mini and a copy of new horizons  the only way nintendo can make this up to their customers is noto remove the one island per console rule and put out a formal apology  i  myself am sending nintendo a dm daily on my instagram  jaycewornick to remove the one console per island rule and i invite others to do so as well  expand
2084,having to share an island between two players was fine  i have just found out only player 1 could progress the save and get the museum built  the second player cannot progress the game  this ruins the game for me as the second player  i would have happy if both players could progress the game but clearly the second player was a second thought  very disappointing 
2085,i love half of this game and hate of it  it feels like they have added in numerous extra steps to get to the fun parts  honestly the crafting mechanic is a terrible addition  there was a real turning point while i was chopping my 20th tree that day  my axe broke and i saw that the requirements to make another axe meant i had to use the very wood i was collecting to make fun things  iti love half of this game and hate of it  it feels like they have added in numerous extra steps to get to the fun parts  honestly the crafting mechanic is a terrible addition  there was a real turning point while i was chopping my 20th tree that day  my axe broke and i saw that the requirements to make another axe meant i had to use the very wood i was collecting to make fun things  it actually just made me feel weary  i turned it off there and then and sold the game  pretty disappointed  expand

2087,really disappointed to discover we cannot have an island each  even if we bought two copies of the game   my sister bought a copy on my switch and now i cannot play the game properly   please fix this 
2088,back in the days  you were able to buy multiple games so you had multiple cities  why the senseless limitations  well  i guess i know already  greed  really sad to see nintendo use methods like that to incentivize switch purchases 
2089,well  i am sure it is a nice time if you are player is nothe first one on the island  but i was the second  and i am done with the game  as it is a pretty lame experience  take that into consideration if you are looking to buy knowing that two or more in the household want to play   it can cause a lot of tension and arguments  and that s not something to introduce to the family when it ishould bewell  i am sure it is a nice time if you are player is nothe first one on the island  but i was the second  and i am done with the game  as it is a pretty lame experience  take that into consideration if you are looking to buy knowing that two or more in the household want to play   it can cause a lot of tension and arguments  and that s not something to introduce to the family when it ishould be something that brings happiness i wouldo not think i ll be buying another nintendo console  i can see this game was designed to push console sales  and it is a bit disappointing and offensive  really  they re making some money now  but likely at the expense of potential later profits  expand
2090,this is nothe most important game of all time  you must play it dont look at ratings just trust me 
2091,i played the original ac to death on my gamecube back in the day  so i should be the ideal player for this game  but while i have grown this game s shallow formula sure hasn t the co op is medieval and the multiplayer in general is set up in atrocious fashion  but my main complaint is just that this game really brings nothing over 2012 s new leaf and in fact seems like a step back ini played the original ac to death on my gamecube back in the day  so i should be the ideal player for this game  but while i have grown this game s shallow formula sure hasn t the co op is medieval and the multiplayer in general is set up in atrocious fashion  but my main complaint is just that this game really brings nothing over 2012 s new leaf and in fact seems like a step back in places  tool durability  really  reggie  animal crossing is a game that has a small amount of quality content parceled out each day  much like a mobile game  which then quickly tapers off to painful grinding  that was okay when i was playing new leaf on my 3ds on the train or wherever  because i had a few minutes to do meaningful content each day while waiting on other stuff  but as a sit down console game it is just a waste of time and attention even worse in my eyes is how awfully stingy the game is and how strictly it dictates the fun you are allowed to have and when you are allowed to have it  it is like playing a boardgame with a spoiled child who wants to tell you what to do on your own turns  you are constantly being told where to go  which npc to listen to  what to look at  what your goals should be  regardless of whether you care at all  and then when you are finally let loose it is with a monumental financial yoke around your neck honestly this game feels like a huge load  if you ve managed to resist the hype please do give it a pass unless nintendo eventually does some kind of update to fix things  though do not expect the slog to change  that s here to stay  i am giving it two points because they certainly made an animal crossing game  and this would ve been hot   in 2001  but i wouldo not think i ll pick it up again  which is notoo bad  because as the island dictator  my absentee character will absolutely kneecap the progress my roommate is allowed to make  great stuff  nintendo  expand
2092,the fact that only one player per console can have their own island or any kind of control over the progression of the island is absolutely ridiculous  i am absolutely boggling that any company thought that would be acceptable to players  if i thought i stood a chance at getting a refund for a  60 game that only one of us can play  i would try 
2093,you need to pay at least 200 dollars  for a switch lite  just to have an individual island between people  unacceptable 
2094,these negative reviews are insane  this is easily one of the greatest games released for the switch to date  playable hours will easily match and exceed games like botw

2096,the co op multiplayer makes this game completely unplayable for the family  so disappointing 
2097,the core game is as good as it always was  talk to animals  catch bugs and go fishing while collecting furniture and expanding your house however  this is nothe most contentless animal crossing since the original  almost 90  of content  meaning shops  activities  items and npcs from new leaf and other entries is missing  it is honestly barren and boring compared to older titles thisthe core game is as good as it always was  talk to animals  catch bugs and go fishing while collecting furniture and expanding your house however  this is nothe most contentless animal crossing since the original  almost 90  of content  meaning shops  activities  items and npcs from new leaf and other entries is missing  it is honestly barren and boring compared to older titles this is a huge step back for the franchise  expand
2098,only one island per switch is stupid  i have multiple family members and will not buy an extra switch  disgusting money grab 
2099,this would be a great game if not for the one island limit per console  i created my account second and i am tired of being treated like a second class citizen  you have 0 power as player two and the island is way too small for multiple people  nintendo needs to stop being greedy and fix this  do not buy unless you have the entire console to yourself 
2100,it is so incredibly relaxing compared to many games but it is not without flaws  its simplicity can also cause understandable polarisation in reviews  if  impatient   action hungry  or  likes to skip cutscenes  describes you at all  you will not enjoy this game  at times the dialogue and real time day progression system will test you but giving it a chance and taking it islow will yieldit is so incredibly relaxing compared to many games but it is not without flaws  its simplicity can also cause understandable polarisation in reviews  if  impatient   action hungry  or  likes to skip cutscenes  describes you at all  you will not enjoy this game  at times the dialogue and real time day progression system will test you but giving it a chance and taking it islow will yield undeniably cute moments worth your waiting  if you plan to play more than one person per switch drop this review score by 3 points  i never liked nintendo s insistence on having ten consoles and copies of the game for per gaming family  expand
2101,this was my first time diving into this cherished franchise and i amust say all my hype and excitement was very much matched  the atmosphere of this game feels exactly like a vacation  a place you can get away and enjoy life however you want  catching fish  planting flowers  visiting new places  a museum  and shopping  all while meeting adorable animal friends along the way  the sheerthis was my first time diving into this cherished franchise and i amust say all my hype and excitement was very much matched  the atmosphere of this game feels exactly like a vacation  a place you can get away and enjoy life however you want  catching fish  planting flowers  visiting new places  a museum  and shopping  all while meeting adorable animal friends along the way  the sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is insane  to a point that a completionist like me wonders if you can really do it all  not that it will stop me from trying  then the social element with friends makes the experience even better  as the communication with hunting bugs and fish  different stuff to craft  or even the stalk market all make you feel like you are apart of something larger as a whole  even lager than the feeling of your own island community gives you  that s exactly the feeling the developers want you to have with this franchise  and it certainly resonates within each and every one of us  and even simplified  visiting islands and showing off your own is just fun   so long as everyone plays nice this was a time in my life when this game was exactly needed  and has brought me so much joy and peace  i know i ll be playing this game for months and years to come  and even when the next animal crossing game comes out  new horizons will always hold a special place in my heart for being my entry into this beautiful series  expand
2102,multiplayer system is   literally no clue who thought this design choice was something players would enjoy  it literally strips all fun for anybody but the first one who logged in  so   dumb

2107,i love this game  every day i play his and i am trying to get 2 of my hated vilagers out  i cannoterraform and make the perfect island  i can breed flowers are much more  this game is a must have 
2108,the game is amazing  everyone rating the game a 0 4 because they cannot have multiple users isn t fair  get off here  and cry somewhere else  what s the big deal  this was explained before the game was released so why did you buy it  you just wanna whine  simple solution buy a switch lite for family member or get gone  the game is unbelievable good and adorable 
2109,the perfect game to these times  it ia relaxing and social challenge with many things to do
2110,secondary player cannot do much  this is insane considering nintendo switch isn t considered as a handheld only console  there is no way to get another island except buying another switch which costs a lot of money that i would never want to spend on
2111,i have had to rewrite my review  i expected more content for player 2 after the first week and upgrading  buildings  sadly this game is only meant for 1 player  if you are not the citizen representative then you are playing a very shallow game  everything you can do is nothing compared to the first person on the island very frustrating experience since there are some great improvementsi have had to rewrite my review  i expected more content for player 2 after the first week and upgrading  buildings  sadly this game is only meant for 1 player  if you are not the citizen representative then you are playing a very shallow game  everything you can do is nothing compared to the first person on the island very frustrating experience since there are some great improvements to other parts of the game  expand
2112,you can only have one island per switch  all accounts on one switch must share one island  and so the first player is nothe only one getting the full experience  this has to be fixed  many people cannot afford to purchase a new switch for everyone who wants to play  i guess nintendo has just decided to be greedy 
2113,the first player creates an island  names it  and plays the second player plays on the island of the first player  he does not have his own island problems between my two daughters i hope nintendo rectifies this design error 
2114,no spoilers here  have hardly played the game for one reason  you can only have one island per switch so if someone else starts the game first it is notheir island and you can only do so much  made me stop playing after an hour 
2115,i have played every animal crossing game as they were released  and was ecstatic for new horizons  the game is beautiful  and you cannotell that a lot of work went into the visuals and scenery  aside from that  i feel like it is lacking even compared to its older predecessors  i was hoping for a greater variety of dialogue with villagers  but interactions are very limited and repetitive  thei have played every animal crossing game as they were released  and was ecstatic for new horizons  the game is beautiful  and you cannotell that a lot of work went into the visuals and scenery  aside from that  i feel like it is lacking even compared to its older predecessors  i was hoping for a greater variety of dialogue with villagers  but interactions are very limited and repetitive  the villagers are the staple of animal crossing  i was so excited to finally have a game that would have rich  personable interaction  more villager games  etc  villagers used to host flea markets and visit your house for fun or vice versa  they used to have interactive aerobics and sports fairs  now they just wander around and do their own thing  but your character does not even have the ability to sit down or join them  i can already predict the 3 5 dialogue options i ll hear each day from every villager  it is disappointing  the lack of amenities is also frustrating  when previous games like city folk and new leaf had coffee shops  theaters  and other stores  we were expecting more   not expecting everything to be taken away  now that i have paved and decorated my town  there really isn t anything to do  i can see that they added the nook miles system as a way to keep you busy but most of us are not interested in doing menial tasks for numbers  we wanted more room for interaction with our villagers and island  once everyone has played for a month or so  they will be finding that there really isn t anything to do in this game  unfortunately i am probably going to end up putting this game down and picking up wild world or new leaf unless some updates roll out to change things  expand

2119,amazing game  it is super addictive  cannot wait to give it a 10 10 when they change the 1 island per switch feature 
2120,the games is fun in the beginning but gets boring very quickly  i was very hyped about the game coming out but it has way many shortcomings and glitches  the easter event going on right now is nothe nightmare you would be living through 
2121,the fact you cannot have multiple islands is just ridiculous and seems like a scheme to sell more switch consoles 
2122,this is nothe best game in the animal crossing series  i would actually give it a 9 10  because it isn t perfect  but i need to balance out all these negative reviews

2128,at first i was having some fun but a little bored that s because when i saw what the first player to log in can do i was disappointed this game is designed for families with multiple children interested in the game but have 1 switch it is main purpose is for you to buy a whole new switch so everyone can experience the game fully 
2129,get rid of the bunny event seriously this stupid event was for fun for an hour but now i cannot catch fish and the sky is constantly full of useless eggs so i have to ignore the ballons and miss the ones that actually give you useful loot or i have to pull my slingshot out every 2 seconds to figure out if it is a useless balloon or one i actually want to go for  i cannot get enough woodget rid of the bunny event seriously this stupid event was for fun for an hour but now i cannot catch fish and the sky is constantly full of useless eggs so i have to ignore the ballons and miss the ones that actually give you useful loot or i have to pull my slingshot out every 2 seconds to figure out if it is a useless balloon or one i actually want to go for  i cannot get enough wood or stone items because half to 2 3 of them turn into those stupid flipping eggs  i cannot get enough fossils for the same reasonthis event has ruined my favourite parts of animal crossing i am no longer enjoying myself  expand

2132,the one island per switch thing is nothe most stupid and scammy thing ever  i just want to play the game without ruining it for my family 
2133,if you are player 1  this is a fun continuation of the animal crossing series  it keeps a lot of core mechanics such as fishing  weeding  bug catching  etc  and adds an interesting crafting mechanic  you get to build up your island with amenities and help new animal neighbors move in  however  if you are not the first player  island representative  your gameplay will be limited  you cannotif you are player 1  this is a fun continuation of the animal crossing series  it keeps a lot of core mechanics such as fishing  weeding  bug catching  etc  and adds an interesting crafting mechanic  you get to build up your island with amenities and help new animal neighbors move in  however  if you are not the first player  island representative  your gameplay will be limited  you cannot help with moving in new villagers or getting shops up and running  you are arbitrarily restricted from parts of the game  you wouldo not get access to crafting recipes or tools you need until player one passes certain milestones  some recipes are only ever given to player one  and there is no way to have access to the whole game as player two  you have to buy a whole new console  yes  console  not game  if you are the only person who uses your switch or nobody else will ever want to play animal crossing on it  it is an excellent game  but expect any secondary players to be locked out of some of the game and disappointed  expand
2134,only one island per switch  seriusly nintendo  we need a update soon 
2135,cannot even meaningfully play as player 2 on one console  total bs that breaks the game 
2136,haha how on earth did they end up restricting it to one island per console  did they only let rich people playtest the game  did they forget that real humans do not have access to infinite switches  absolutely surreal incompetence and the most nintendo thing i have ever seen  they consistently manage to make the best games out there and then run then under terrible ui and restrictive design choices 
2137,cannot share animal crossing to family members to create their own island  rather  they re treated as your employees and the only purpose is noto gather and provide resources  so you have to buy a second switch and switch online to make playing animal crossing with family members possible  almost as bad sellout as sony indefinitely postponing last of us 2 because of the pandemic  it is almostcannot share animal crossing to family members to create their own island  rather  they re treated as your employees and the only purpose is noto gather and provide resources  so you have to buy a second switch and switch online to make playing animal crossing with family members possible  almost as bad sellout as sony indefinitely postponing last of us 2 because of the pandemic  it is almost like digital games never event existed  also  animal crossing is super boring  all you wouldo is collect fishes and bugs  i actually thought it was like farmville where you plant and harvest crops veges under certain time periods to grow your island  cannot even get a refund cause eb games is closed till the pandemic is over  expand
2138,where do i begin  no this isn t your regular blind rant of someone complaining about  one switch one island  i am here to educate you why i chose to give this sorry installment they would like to call new horizons this score  allow me to elaborate first and foremost this is an excellent single player game  to call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside youwhere do i begin  no this isn t your regular blind rant of someone complaining about  one switch one island  i am here to educate you why i chose to give this sorry installment they would like to call new horizons this score  allow me to elaborate first and foremost this is an excellent single player game  to call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside you telling you that it is  after many iteration this latest installment offers nothing and i amean zero new concepts  ideas or features involving multiplayer game play  that is what makes this such a lackluster game  i amean you go to a town and then what  nothing absolutely nothing especially those posh elites thinking that you must do nothing to change a town or even run because it wears out the grass  why have them over then  to show off your island that was obtained obviously by means of time travel and you have the audacity to set rules on your throne of lies  seriously if you time travel you are only cheating yourself of the true experience of the game which is noto grind and work hard for your accomplishments and should think twice about posting your perfect town for fake internet points  with nothing to penalize time traveler they just ruin the point of the game and finish it within a week  this game offers nothing new compared to the older games in fact the museum received an overhaul on its interior yet there is less to fill it with  yes that s right because there are no paintings and no deep sea creatures to turn in another thing about that  there is still no new additions to the bug  fish and fossils list and that s shameful just going to find the same ones over again with nothing new to find the crafting system was the most exciting thing i wanted  until the gimic ran out faster than starting tools could last  seriously it became more of a chore than a fun feature  there is no insensitive to get better gear if the cheapest one does the same job as a golden version of the tool  and on that note how about you explain why golden tools break  they are not supposed to break they are a symbol of one s accomplishments to obtain them and should not be reduced to the games gimic do not get me started with the island tour nonsense  and i paraphrase each island you go to will never be the same as the last so make sure you wouldo everything you can before you leave because we will not be coming back ever yet  there are countless times i have visited the island with the same layout and same island shape and nothing in them  way to bait and switch the experience of visiting 5 islands on end with slight differences i am glad that the events are stowed away so people cannot just time travel to get everything off season that s right i am talking to you time travelers  you are no better than businesses selling their christmas stuff in august  boy how hypothetical you all must be worst part is nothat they made a conscious decision to push the game release date further down the to ensure quality yet there is so many bugs in the game especially game breaking  you can lose your save file for popping a balloon in the sky  yup every time you wouldo that you risk data loss  tell me again why was the game pushed back  if that was the  choice why was not time spent to better multiplayer features  to summarize the game is great single player  terrible multiplayer and so much content is missing the game is bare bones and i am not talking about holiday things i am talking about what to do in game  there is nothing to do after an hour of play because the daily chores are completed that fast  expand
2139,one dictator  seven slaves same console multiplayer is a huge disappointment  we bought this game to  share  it  one island  one screen  shared decisions and contribution

2141,there is a few issues i have with this game  the lack of online interactive related things and unnecessary long transitions when people leave your island  the fact that there is only a real time option  and that there is no way in game to advertise your island  i would love a brochure to sell your island  tell people you have certain things there and be more social with it by showing it offthere is a few issues i have with this game  the lack of online interactive related things and unnecessary long transitions when people leave your island  the fact that there is only a real time option  and that there is no way in game to advertise your island  i would love a brochure to sell your island  tell people you have certain things there and be more social with it by showing it off maybe and saying stuff like hey  i have a tarantula island  come on by  create more of a city  involve more on your island  i just feel it is so limited for not really a good reason but to be a cop out  i would love more interaction with the citizens and events with them  everything seems so bare bones for a  60 game i would also enjoy it if you had sort ve a function to treat it like stardew valley where it had it is own hastened day night cycle to an extent  i would like to at least play the game in a few weeks  enjoy all there is noto see  and catch do quests for everyone in that time frame  it is just not there  just nooks increasing debt with everything you wouldo  i get that animal crossing may just not be for me however  i wouldo not think a lot of what i said are bad idea s nor would make people dislike the game any   do people really enjoy the game mostly being played only an hour or so at a time and all these things that you probably wont ever get done because you may not be playing in the september time frame to catch certain things the last thing is nothe most obvious though  not sharing your island  me and my gf share the switch because i barely play nintendo games and so she somewhat does  so very little reason to own two  people telling others why not just own 2 switches  stop being poor  why should we be punished for their poor design choice  such a weird thing to defend a company on  expand
2142,if you own this game and a switch just for yourself you will probably like this game very much   but if you share a console with someone  a family member or your girl boyfriend  it will undoubtedly end with an arguments and anger  i cannot even imagine having two children and one console  i will recommend this game only if nintendo fix this no  of players limitation 
2143,1 island per switch ruins the experience for both players due to having to fight for resources  nintendo s solution  buy another switch for a measly 300 dollars  if you can find one one in stock    this game and   nintendo s greedy asses
2144,only one island per switch  not even per game  worst decision ever  my girlfriend bought the game and is notherefore player one but now i have to wait for her to progress the story  i cannot even buy my own copy of the game to fix this it is infuriating 
2145,fantastic game if you play on your own switch   slow start  but then is flawless 
2146,my wife and i were looking forward to playing this game when it released  i bought it  i let her play first she made an island and played for a bit  then i wouldecided to play only to discover that nintendo only allows one island per switch  not only that  the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do  so  if you have more than one personmy wife and i were looking forward to playing this game when it released  i bought it  i let her play first she made an island and played for a bit  then i wouldecided to play only to discover that nintendo only allows one island per switch  not only that  the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do  so  if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game  you need two switches  worst decision i have ever seen  this even beats ea congratulations nintendo  you have officially become the worst video game company this year  expand

2149,nintendo decided to force my fiancée and i to share an island  we do not need a second switch since we are adults with full time jobs and do not play enough to warrant a second switch  sharing an island is not the worst thing but waiting years to find this out was quite a disappointment  we have a ps4 and have separate accounts with separate save files  why cannot nintendo do the same 
2150,am i really supposed to spend 300  more to buy another switch and another game to not mess my girlfriend island or simply have my own  the game that s supposed to calm me has me so pissed i amade an account here just to give it a bad review 
2151,if you have kids you have to purchase another switch as you can only have one island making your 2nd on the game loosingnout in progressing and is more or less obsolete
2152,a master class in corporate greed   this isn t a game so much as the visual manifestation of a spreadsheet  you cannot have multiple islands per console  hence there can only be one player who gets to do the story missions from nook  your online account is linked to the animal crossing user rather than to the switch user  so you cannot have someone visit your island unless you are playinga master class in corporate greed   this isn t a game so much as the visual manifestation of a spreadsheet  you cannot have multiple islands per console  hence there can only be one player who gets to do the story missions from nook  your online account is linked to the animal crossing user rather than to the switch user  so you cannot have someone visit your island unless you are playing as the person who has an online account or unless you pay for multiple online accounts  truly jaw droppingly anti consumer  do yourself a favor and skip this wretch  expand
2153,the local multiplayer on this game is so badly designed it is a hate crime  i wish i had never bought this game  please take your game back and give me my money back nintendo 
2154,just like every animal crossing game this is chill fun game  i play it about a hour a day or longer if i am playing with friends  it lets you pretty much place furniture anywhere iso you can really make the island your own 
2155,only  one  save file  island  per switch only the  first  player gets any real control over the island  selecting where buildings go  terraforming  etc any other players basically get to watch player one play the game feels like it was pushed out early and more will be added in updates nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together only  one  save file  island  per switch only the  first  player gets any real control over the island  selecting where buildings go  terraforming  etc any other players basically get to watch player one play the game feels like it was pushed out early and more will be added in updates nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together  unless you intend to play this game alone  i suggest avoiding it the saddest part is  a ton of negativity would go away if they removed the one island restriction  expand
2156,nintendo has made an interesting marketing decision for a supposed family company and directly put families in the ditch with how they have decided to manage the saves in the game  they have decided that there can only be one island per switch not per account which confuses me as a player since every other switch title  pokémon  fire emblem  breath of the wild  stardew valley  super smashnintendo has made an interesting marketing decision for a supposed family company and directly put families in the ditch with how they have decided to manage the saves in the game  they have decided that there can only be one island per switch not per account which confuses me as a player since every other switch title  pokémon  fire emblem  breath of the wild  stardew valley  super smash bros ult  and mario kart  all extremely popular titles and games that have brought the switch up to level with playstation and xbox and they all have seperate saves  i genuinely do not understand a player focused decision other than they want to make as much money as possible off of players  please nintendo  fix this for the people who love the game but also want to play it with their family members and even friends because i wouldo not want myself or them to be forced to delete their save so that another person can experience the full game  expand

2158,the game itself is amazing but the fact that only one island is allowed per switch ruins the game for me 
2159,only the first player is nothe one who can keep unlocking things in the game   secondary players can only get resources and depend on the first   furthermore  it does not allow you to have one island per player   at home we were disappointed in this  since i wouldepend on the first player  a shame 
2160,limiting the game to one island per switch is a inexcusable greedy anti consumer move 
2161,bought this game for two young kids to play  only to find out too late that they have to share the same island  perhaps nintendo have never met siblings who are not great at sharing  perhaps they think all sisters get along all the time and never get angry with the other for touching their stuff  it would be lovely to imagine that was true  but they must have known the problems it wouldbought this game for two young kids to play  only to find out too late that they have to share the same island  perhaps nintendo have never met siblings who are not great at sharing  perhaps they think all sisters get along all the time and never get angry with the other for touching their stuff  it would be lovely to imagine that was true  but they must have known the problems it would cause and did it anyway  so  1 out of 10 from me for such a cynical and greedy decision  expand

2170,i came in as a new person to the franchise and i find myself having fun with it  the zen style of gameplay is a nice change from the usual  though i wish they put more thought into this games as the design of some aspects seem short sighted most jarringly at first i noticed was the 5am gates  any time you progress the island a step  the game will lock any further progression behind ai came in as a new person to the franchise and i find myself having fun with it  the zen style of gameplay is a nice change from the usual  though i wish they put more thought into this games as the design of some aspects seem short sighted most jarringly at first i noticed was the 5am gates  any time you progress the island a step  the game will lock any further progression behind a 5am tomorrow gate  mind you this isn t real time  as it will unlock at 5am tomorrow regardless of when you hit the gate  this makes certain buildings a chore  most notably the museum  you get gated after 5 donations to tom then  after 15 more donations to blathers  which is nothen followed by a mandatory 24h construction period  this process takes 48 to 72 hours depending on when you made the first 5 donations  which feels annoying because you need to hold onto any discoveries you find for that time next is progression  which for the most part punishes you for doing so  a good example of this is buying from timmy   tommy  at the start of the game you can buy   sell from them freely until you get nook s cranny  when you wouldo you can only buy   sell normally until 10pm  you can sell using the box at any time with it only being 80  of normal selling price  this detail annoys me so much  if the shop hours was going to be a thing  why not have it always be like that  that way it does not feel like they are restricting features or selling for less because you are past the time frame  the box could have been a positive feature by letting you sell past close time  but instead it is just presented in a way that punishes the player the tool system isn t much different  tools break and there are stronger versions available for the right material  but they never change the act of collecting and can actually be a downgrade if the player isn t careful  this can be seen with the iron axe  which does not increase the amount of wood dropped and instead will chop down a tree on the 3rd hit  preventing it from growing again and stopping you from collecting wood  there is no reason to use the iron axe over the stone one  which offers the same amount of drops without destroying the source and still offers a fair amount of hits  if you wouldo want to move a tree  just use shovel   fruit which actually put it into your inventory to move sell there are other odd details that have not impacted me much as a solo player being the only one on my switch  but having a single island per console is really not fun since if you want to try local multiplayer you need to place additional tents down on your island to do so  multiplayer isn t that well explained by the game in general  overall i wouldo like the game  but the design clashes a lot with the zen game it is trying to be bunny day update  oh boy i wouldo like being able to progress even less because of eggs appearing instead of needed materials  this game already has too much rng  expand

2179,why cant we batch craft  why cannot crafting pull from resources in storage  how come mable can place clothing i bought into storage for me when  i  do not even have that ability  why cannot we select multiple items to buy from the tailor  instead having to purchase one at a time to leave and re enter to buy the other colour options of a shirt i want  why cannot i select multiple items in mywhy cant we batch craft  why cannot crafting pull from resources in storage  how come mable can place clothing i bought into storage for me when  i  do not even have that ability  why cannot we select multiple items to buy from the tailor  instead having to purchase one at a time to leave and re enter to buy the other colour options of a shirt i want  why cannot i select multiple items in my inventory and choose to send them all to storage  why can i access nook phone while sitting but not my inventory  why cannot we sit on the ground next to villagers  why are not we allowed to meet villagers on mystery islands when we have full residence on island  why cannot we choose to buy multiple of items through the terminal  it is a pain to buy a nook miles ticket  wait for it to print out  choose to purchase more one at a time why cannot we move buildings over by just a tile or two  i have had to move a house store somewhere else completely to then move it back to it is original location  just 2 spaces to the left  why is nothere nothing to do with friends in this game  where are the island minigames like in new leaf why cannot we ride the carnival rocking horsies like we have seen in footage leading up to the release  why does nook s cranny take so long to upgrade   you would think a store upgrade would come before you even get the chance to have an entirely new tailor shop take root in your island  why does the upgrade only include one extra furniture slot  remember all the nook store upgrades in new leaf  wow i want to craft multiple bait at a time  i want to place rugs on the ground outside  i want tables and counters to place my items on  i want golden tools to not break  or at least last way longer than they do now  i want to  have access to all furniture colour swatches be able to manually customize the others if i own one the multiplayer in this game is so limiting  i want more furniture sets  this game could stand to be a hell of a lot more user friendly  bro  expand
2180,absolutely unforgivable  bought this game with my sister and she played for first and now i am a little more than an npc  i want to play the full game  embarassing in 2020 something like that 
2181,it is just so stupid that you can only have one island per console  im the 2nd player which means that i hardly get to do anything no building structures and no story  fix this now nintendo
2182,a game that can only be played by one account  and its not about the horrible multiplayer  you cannot even play it isingleplayer as a second acount 
2183,i own the game  if your wife  girlfriend  boyfriend  brother  dad  anyone launches and starts the game before you  say goodbye to your progress  you cannot or contribute to the progression of the island  as only the representative of the island  the first player running and playing the game  needs to unlock the features  besides that  i just discovered certain feature that i cannot have andi own the game  if your wife  girlfriend  boyfriend  brother  dad  anyone launches and starts the game before you  say goodbye to your progress  you cannot or contribute to the progression of the island  as only the representative of the island  the first player running and playing the game  needs to unlock the features  besides that  i just discovered certain feature that i cannot have and only first player has received  which ruined this game for me  the one that buyed and proposed the game at home  such a disappointment  you have been warned  expand
2184,the game does not let you progress if someone started the game before you  either let us progress or give us a different island  having both makes this game really unplayable
2185,my wife was super excited to play this game although it is not necessarily my style of game   she prompted me to start a character first because she was busy the day we got it  and then when she went to start a character later we discovered that only one island may be played per console and that she would have to play based off my sloppy seconds  this just feels so wrong and a gross attemptmy wife was super excited to play this game although it is not necessarily my style of game   she prompted me to start a character first because she was busy the day we got it  and then when she went to start a character later we discovered that only one island may be played per console and that she would have to play based off my sloppy seconds  this just feels so wrong and a gross attempt to get the players to spend more money  my wife barely plays games and we were so turned off by this nothat we are going to return the game   awful representation by nintendo and a stain on their brand in my mind  expand
2186,my sister and i wouldid not knew about the one island  i started the game first  and now shes angry at me  we do not want to play together  and the fact that nintendo is so greedy to try and use this method to make us by a second switch is unforgivable  having fun  want another person in your house to have fun to  buy another expansive product  they should change it asap 
2187,the secondary account simply cannot progress in the game  the second account cannot build anything  all that we can do is build small items and walk around
2188,the main issue people will direct at this game is nothe same console multiplayer debacle  it isn t a huge issue in my eyes  it is not exactly like offering multiple saves was a series tradition or anything  to me  the main issue plaguing animal crossing  new horizons is nothe endless tedium and monotonous gameplay that gets excused by the series take it easy  relax  no pressure conceit the main issue people will direct at this game is nothe same console multiplayer debacle  it isn t a huge issue in my eyes  it is not exactly like offering multiple saves was a series tradition or anything  to me  the main issue plaguing animal crossing  new horizons is nothe endless tedium and monotonous gameplay that gets excused by the series take it easy  relax  no pressure conceit  well  i would like to relax  but the inordinate time spent between menus  the minuscule inventory  and the lack of meaningful improvements over previous entries is getting in the way  expand

2190,one island per switch is insane  you guys at nintendo sure know how to come up with good ideas and totally ruin them  will not touch this game again unless you can have more than one island per switch 
2191,local multiplayer is a huge disappointment and there is barely content  many buildings are missing for example the policestation 
2192,the multiplayer absolutely stinks in this game  corporate greed is nothe aim of this game by trying to force you to buy an additional switch due to the problems with the system they created  madness 
2193,0 because i cannot even play it because my brother was the first one to play it  thanks a lot who ever is responsible for the great idea of making all users on a switch play on the same island

2195,my brother received this game for his birthday and we were both super excited to have our islands but after he made his island we arealized that it was only 1 island per switch  this is such a stupid  dumb  idiotic rule  now my brother is nothe only one who can play the game and i am stuck not being able to play  would not buy for multiple people 
2196,animal crossing  new horizons is a great single player game  the game was heavily advertised as a multiplayer game for the whole family which isn t the case  one player picks the island  names the island  and overall has the better experience  but i wouldo not understand the harsh feedback  this game s  island sharing functionality  isn t any different from previous titles in the franchise  ianimal crossing  new horizons is a great single player game  the game was heavily advertised as a multiplayer game for the whole family which isn t the case  one player picks the island  names the island  and overall has the better experience  but i wouldo not understand the harsh feedback  this game s  island sharing functionality  isn t any different from previous titles in the franchise  i understand the frustration but i wouldo not understand why it is being review bombed for this reason alone  expand
2197,this game has caused lots of heartache for my kids  the fact that you can only do one island per console is a terrible thing to do to children  each wanted to make their own island and visit each other s island  but greedy stupid nintendo really screwed this game up

2202,my issue with the game is nothat the controls are overly sensitive in that if you are one pixel off the fish will not see the line and if you are digging a hole or wanting to plant something the odds of it being where you want is about 40  it is also too easy to undo something that you wanted because the controls are so sensitive picky  if you had an update with the options of simpler controlsmy issue with the game is nothat the controls are overly sensitive in that if you are one pixel off the fish will not see the line and if you are digging a hole or wanting to plant something the odds of it being where you want is about 40  it is also too easy to undo something that you wanted because the controls are so sensitive picky  if you had an update with the options of simpler controls and interactions similar to pocket camp  the game would be much more relaxing and enjoyable  the other issue is nothe mystery island ai  there ishould be a quiz or something at the beginning of the game that is focused on which villager type or style you like because i  and probably many others  have wasted over 20 nook miles tickets and over 40 000 nook miles trying to find the villager i want or at least a decent villager to invite  or the least you could do is make nook miles tickets cheaper  or have them be purchasable with bells  because at a certain point it is hard to get enough nook miles  or there at least has to be a way to invite a villager other than buying an amiibo card  it frustrated me so much that i just reset and deleted the game and it will probably take me 2 more weeks of quarantine to be bored enough to try again  expand
2203,i love this game  love it  but as previously stated by hundreds of people  not being the main island representative sucks  when you go on the nintendo support page  they just state that another switch needs to be purchased for someone to have their own island  i wouldo not know about everyone else  but right now  especially during this period of quarantine  i wouldo not have a damn dime to spare  ii love this game  love it  but as previously stated by hundreds of people  not being the main island representative sucks  when you go on the nintendo support page  they just state that another switch needs to be purchased for someone to have their own island  i wouldo not know about everyone else  but right now  especially during this period of quarantine  i wouldo not have a damn dime to spare  i wouldo not have cash to just throw at another switch  for us new ac players  this has been a major wake up call  so frustrating  expand
2204,the game is great apart from a massive design flaw of not allowing multiple islands  this would be a 9 or 10 with this feature  this is literally tearing the community apart and should be available  needing to buy a new console to have another island is beyond the reach of 90  of players and families  whoever thought that this would just work most likely does not have children as each wouldthe game is great apart from a massive design flaw of not allowing multiple islands  this would be a 9 or 10 with this feature  this is literally tearing the community apart and should be available  needing to buy a new console to have another island is beyond the reach of 90  of players and families  whoever thought that this would just work most likely does not have children as each would like to have their own island and own experience of the game  this should be a call to the devs to make this change as soon as they possibly can with the virus taken into account  expand

2206,this is one of the worst games i have ever played   not only that  but nintendo s no refund policy should be illegal   i will never buy another nintendo game again   knew getting a switch was a mistake   ridiculous 
2207,one save limitation is so frustrating  i cannot fully enjoy the game therefore i wasted my meny  do not buy untill this is fixed 
2208,the inability to have different islands in multiple save files fundamentally breaks what would otherwise be an amazing game  absolutely terrible for families  a stupid marketing decision for such a family friendly game

2210,i was spinning my wheels upgrading my house and waiting for the main story elements like upgrading island  eventually i learned that the band developers block  all except the main switch account from making progress in the game   i bought ghf game and basically it completely sucks and has no story backbone because the creators decided to block 2ndary accounts 
2211,this is one of the best games i have ever played in my life  it dose have it is flaws but everything does so it isn t worth giving a bad rating just to try to prove something 
2212,the one island per console system has spoiled an otherwise fantastic game for my family 
2213,nice phone app for a not to smart 12 year old girl not recommended for adults 
2214,animal crossing  new horizons is a new school tamagotchi  pure gameplay  like sims and etc  cannot recommend to everyone

2216,i am actively writing this review while playing with my husband primary account holder   i have time to write  because the secondary player on the switch account can never play a large portion of the game  without having 2 switches  secondary player has no input on tasks to building up the island  it was my first animal crossing and my husband was excited to introduce me to this game i am actively writing this review while playing with my husband primary account holder   i have time to write  because the secondary player on the switch account can never play a large portion of the game  without having 2 switches  secondary player has no input on tasks to building up the island  it was my first animal crossing and my husband was excited to introduce me to this game  but so far this game has left me without any experiences  because they re only for the main account holder to complete  it is a simple fix that nintendo has refused to acknowledge  expand
2217,i got the game as a birthday gift but let my sister play too as she had long wanted to play this game  i amade the mistake of letting her play first  consequently i became the player 2 and only then realized i could not create my own island  there really isn t that much fun to do as a player 2  i am really disappointed  i really hope nintendo fixes this issue 
2218,i have literally never been so disappointed in a while  the first and probably most obvious problem that a lot of other people are talking about is nothe 1st player priority and 1 town per switch  put it isimply  ac is a terrible shared console game  i can say that for literally most of the ac games  not much of an issue for the last game because it was on the 3ds and people usually got theiri have literally never been so disappointed in a while  the first and probably most obvious problem that a lot of other people are talking about is nothe 1st player priority and 1 town per switch  put it isimply  ac is a terrible shared console game  i can say that for literally most of the ac games  not much of an issue for the last game because it was on the 3ds and people usually got their own 3ds  and even then  i would argue it was still a better shared console game  it is even worse in nh because it treats the 1st player special and all the other players are just useless  they can still destroy   so gl sharing with someone younger  no backup save  no transfer  no alternative way of getting a different town other than giving nintendo more of your money during a time like this where we d all rather save it  of course there are more reasons to hate this game that has nothing to do with the multiplayer based reasons  remember ordinances  gone  swimming  gone  coffee shop  gone  completely different areas with unique themes that were really useful  kinda but not as good as before  perfect fruits  gone  reliable tools  gone   but tools breaking tools adds challenge  challenge as in being obnoxious  remember this mechanic in botw  it worked there because 1  i wouldo not have to go through the same obnoxious crafting cutscene to make one again and 2  the breaking tools actually encouraged conservation and different strategies to fighting  meanwhile in this game  it is just a strain on your already limited resources that you get once per day  the survival resource scavenging thing does not fit ac at all  when you break your fishing rod  there is no alternative choice than to build another one  also   eggs  expand
2219,to be honest  this is a great game  it is very laid back and destressing  i like everything about it  except one really big issue  i wouldo not want to be an ordinary villager who cannot do anything besides collecting and gathering stuff   it really blows to be the second player  nintendo  let us enjoy our very own island and give everyone in the household the full experience 
2220,one island per console ruined the entire game for those who have to share the console 
2221,great looking game  wish i was not gated from doing anything as the second person to play it on the system  another case of trash design on a great game 
2222,i think i would like the game but i am unable to progress because my daughter has the primary character  so i am unable to get the full experience  it would be nice if there was a warning in the beginning  then i would have set myself as the primary and then both of us would enjoy the game 
2223,disappointed  my partner and i bought this game for our nintendo switch and while she s player 1 and enjoying the game very much  i have no enjoyment or desire to progress with the game due to the ridiculous and downright appaling decision to limit one island per switch rather than one island per user  that is all 
2224,it is a great game  but there is a big problem  when the first person who create your island do not play anymore or just less than you  you wouldo not have a complete access to the game 
2225,i wouldo not care that you get one island per switch  that seems like a design choice that allows families to play together  what is ridiculous is nothat the 2nd person to play the game cannot advance without the 1st person to play doing so first   i wouldid not realize this mechanic until about 10 hours in  so now we have to start from scratch   why isn t there an option to just switch the residenti wouldo not care that you get one island per switch  that seems like a design choice that allows families to play together  what is ridiculous is nothat the 2nd person to play the game cannot advance without the 1st person to play doing so first   i wouldid not realize this mechanic until about 10 hours in  so now we have to start from scratch   why isn t there an option to just switch the resident representative  expand
2226,either allow more islands per console or allow all players on the single island to have equal rights and and resposibilities to contribute to all aspects of island life   failing these options  there ishould at the very least be some way for the citizen representative pass there role to another player   shocking design choice for a game advertised as multiplayer in the year 2020 
2227,no tiene sentido que dos personas no puedan tener cada uno su propia isla  muy decepcionado la verdad
2228,nintendo worst company ever  you wouldo not care about customers  but you are nothing without us  once island per switch  shame on you  
2229,review bombers have formed a very vocal echo chamber on here  but instead of focusing on the negatives that can be fixed  the game itself is objectively one of the best in the series  for those new to the ac experience  do not expect a ton of varied gameplay  acnh is designed to be a relaxing life sim that has you areturn for short bursts of play rather than keeping you for hours at a time review bombers have formed a very vocal echo chamber on here  but instead of focusing on the negatives that can be fixed  the game itself is objectively one of the best in the series  for those new to the ac experience  do not expect a ton of varied gameplay  acnh is designed to be a relaxing life sim that has you areturn for short bursts of play rather than keeping you for hours at a time acnh has the most customization of any animal crossing title  allowing a wide variety of furniture and decorations to be customized to your liking it is obnoxious that there is only one island per console  and that player 2 really does not have much to do until the main player progresses  but a lot of these issues were disclosed well before launch it is still a great game  and it is still animal crossing  expand
2230,do not buy this game if you are looking to share it with someone  only the player who started the game is able to progress the story and develop the island  the majority of the new and interesting features shown in gameplay trailers will be unavailable to other players  these unnecessary restrictions ruin an otherwise enjoyable game 
2231,if you have more than 1 person using the game  it is worthless  until they fix player 2 story line  do not get the game  i am done with nintendo unless they fix this  huge waste of money 
2232,to the people who call the backlash an unjustified review bombing you probably are playing single player and have no issues  to rank a game on just a part of it and expect everyone else to ignore the giant issue and give the game an a  is stupid  also there were complaints about single island before the game even came out and they never bothered fixing it  the only way they are going toto the people who call the backlash an unjustified review bombing you probably are playing single player and have no issues  to rank a game on just a part of it and expect everyone else to ignore the giant issue and give the game an a  is stupid  also there were complaints about single island before the game even came out and they never bothered fixing it  the only way they are going to fix it is by people vocally saying it is a problem and making the game unenjoyable to many i would not mind buying a 2nd copy of the game but needing a 2nd switch at the cheapest 260  per switch plus the games 80  each for a whopping total of 680 cad  for two people to enjoy their own island is absurd  there is no point in buying a 2nd console just for animal crossing alone   nintendo is noturning into bethesda blizzard  would not be surprised if mtx and lootboxes or other surprise mechanics on the way when you have a game that you own and cannot even get yourself motivated to play it despite loving the genre and 100s of hours in past entries simply because you have two players and one console you truly deserve a 0  expand

2234,i had been looking forward to this game for a long time  but unfortunately i share my switch console with another ac player  so now i have to share an island and when i log on there are not even sticks left to complete the diy workshop  on top of that if i want my own island i cannot even blow money on a second copy of the game  i would have to buy an entire new console  what a joke 
2235,i bought this game so me and my family could play it  i started it  then handed it to my sister  who cannot start her own island due to nintendo changing the way saves are done for this game  instead of treating each profile on the switch like their own save file  like every other game on the switch does  they treat the entire system as one big save file  which makes the game completelyi bought this game so me and my family could play it  i started it  then handed it to my sister  who cannot start her own island due to nintendo changing the way saves are done for this game  instead of treating each profile on the switch like their own save file  like every other game on the switch does  they treat the entire system as one big save file  which makes the game completely unfair to anyone else  now my sister is waiting  hoping that nintendo changes this god awful feature  as she is depressed over the virus  and i fear for her life if she does not have something to hope forue to the virus  we are loosing jobs  so we cannot afford another system  not that we want another system anyway  nintendo has lost a life long customer due to the amount of selfish  crazy decisions they have made within the past two years  expand
2236,tons to do compared to the original and ww which were the last two in the series i played  so i ll just keep this simple and list the pros and cons pros  tons to do around the island and always having an objective to work towards even if it is at your own pace it is nice to have something to work toward the island is always growing and gives you a real sense of progression  it reallytons to do compared to the original and ww which were the last two in the series i played  so i ll just keep this simple and list the pros and cons pros  tons to do around the island and always having an objective to work towards even if it is at your own pace it is nice to have something to work toward the island is always growing and gives you a real sense of progression  it really feels like you are building something great many more residents per island then in the past and more variety when it comes to resident personality over all graphics and visual presentation is great as well as sound design the ability to have local co op is amazing and something i could ve only dreamed of as a kid who i played the original with my brother on gamecube cons  one island per console i know this has been stated to death but it is ridiculous that in this day and age that it is not technically plausible the restrictions on co op are a bit frustrating as i stated i am stoked that they added local co op but it just sucks they had to make it iso stripped if only they could ve added a few more things  i amean simple things like both users being able to manage their menu instead of only the leader that s really all i wish they would ve done honestly  i would not even ask for split iscreens or anything just the ability for both players to be able to pick up and sell items would ve been amazing but instead it just feels like a half measure  it always ends up being a game of watching the leader do things or changing frequently so the other player can get stuff done  frustrating because it could ve been something so great animal crossing is what amounts to be an amazing game  it just struggles on the multiplayer side of things which has never been nintendo s strong suit except when it comes to local play so how did they mess it up so bad  it is unfortunate because that is what keeps this from being a full 10 in my eyes  it just feels like maybe the local play was a last minute thing they threw in and did not get the tlc it deserved  and it just pains me to think of what could ve been  expand
2237,overall the game is great  the only thing that really bothers me is nothat villagers always say the same things  they do not seem to have a real character anymore  and their sentences are always really short and sometimes pretty mean  it would be great if nintendo could re work that  
2238,one island per switch  disgusting  do not purchase until problem is rectified  bought to play with family and now my purchase means nothing and i am diminished to playing follow the leader  considering moving onto a console that respects their clients 
2239,i bought the game on a switch shared by my wife and me  and i created my character and visited the island first  then she created her character and visited the island  you can only have one island on a console  come to find out  she cannot progress at all in the game until i play it  and she does not have any ability to improve the island on her own  what an absolutely boneheaded gamei bought the game on a switch shared by my wife and me  and i created my character and visited the island first  then she created her character and visited the island  you can only have one island on a console  come to find out  she cannot progress at all in the game until i play it  and she does not have any ability to improve the island on her own  what an absolutely boneheaded game design  if you plan on having multiple people play this game at once  i would warn you not to waste your money  expand
2240,this game is probably fantastic but i cannot play it in anyway it is truly meant to be because they only allow one person per console to play the game  i wouldo not care that one island  can support 8 players because there is only one person able to do anything fun  they rest are just sentient npcs  it is unfair and unjustifiable  it is completely unrealistic to expect families to spend a minimumthis game is probably fantastic but i cannot play it in anyway it is truly meant to be because they only allow one person per console to play the game  i wouldo not care that one island  can support 8 players because there is only one person able to do anything fun  they rest are just sentient npcs  it is unfair and unjustifiable  it is completely unrealistic to expect families to spend a minimum of 270 dollars for every person who wants to play this game the way it ishould be played  no other games have this restriction meaning this was done intentionally to drag more money out of already paying customer  ridiculous  big fail on nintendo s side  expand
2241,so i have been enjoying the game  i have been working on my island and have gotten pasted nooks cranny but then my brother ask to play  now i have it downloaded on my switch  this would be fine if f king animal crossing worked like any other 60 dollar game on switch  i went to do something while my brother started his game  then when i came back i noticed that his airport was near where myso i have been enjoying the game  i have been working on my island and have gotten pasted nooks cranny but then my brother ask to play  now i have it downloaded on my switch  this would be fine if f king animal crossing worked like any other 60 dollar game on switch  i went to do something while my brother started his game  then when i came back i noticed that his airport was near where my air port was then i saw my house and before i could say anything he put his notent down and now it is just f king stuck in my game  this is nothe most aggravating cheap a  move i have ever seen nintendo pull  this game would straight up be a 10 if my brother did not exist or much better if nintendo had more than one f king brain cell  i will not be mad at my brother because he is younger than me and he just wanted to play animal crossing but i need to be mad at someone because now my f king town has a random a  tent in it  expand
2242,sure it is a great game if you are the only player but nintendo can get   for the 2nd player limitations they have instituted  do not buy this unless you support nintendo s ploy to hold customers ransom in hopes that they will buy a whole second or third console just so everyone in the house can play this game 
2243,no cloud saves  no legitimate local multiplayer  no sharing the game between users on the same switch  no save transfer between consoles  this game is a massive failure on a technical level by 2020 standards  and embarrassingly even by the original animal crossing from 19 years ago  which did not lock your save to the console

2247,i wanted to try out animal crossing because of the fans   i played for about a week and while relaxing  i started to realize it was not my kind of game   it was just too simplistic in what you could do in the game   i know the game expands later but it just took too much time for me to get there without the feeling of incentive to come back   it also felt a bit too kiddish for me   the slowi wanted to try out animal crossing because of the fans   i played for about a week and while relaxing  i started to realize it was not my kind of game   it was just too simplistic in what you could do in the game   i know the game expands later but it just took too much time for me to get there without the feeling of incentive to come back   it also felt a bit too kiddish for me   the slow progression of the game was really too slow for me and just felt like there was not much game there   also  the villagers would not say much of interest and repeat the same things  and while i like games where you have to figure out things on your own  it also was not very intuitive on what to do at times for new players to the series   in my experience  it felt very half baked   the core gameplay felt like what i could do in other games which are a lot more fun  varied  and engaging   the one main plus was the cute  polished hd visuals  expand
2248,animal crossing  new horizons is a great game  but does have some downsides i have been playing this game over 2 weeks now and i love it  gathering fossils  fishing  bug catching and as of now the bunny day week  event   as i have seen online most people had their island mostly done by time traveling  as for me i will be not time traveling   but this is a game that keeps me coming backanimal crossing  new horizons is a great game  but does have some downsides i have been playing this game over 2 weeks now and i love it  gathering fossils  fishing  bug catching and as of now the bunny day week  event   as i have seen online most people had their island mostly done by time traveling  as for me i will be not time traveling   but this is a game that keeps me coming back and slowly watching my island grow with each new finished project or a new guest comes and visits the island  but as i am playing game it can gets boring after 2 hours of gameplay   but because there only so much you can do in a real time game but overall if you are big fan or new comer to animal crossing series this a game that is worth checking picking up will update later in the year  expand
2249,my boyfriend and i bought the game together and he was the first one to play  and now i am stuck as the 2nd player who do not get the same experience  it isucks because we both payed but now only one really gets the opportunity to play  really disappointing
2250,do not buy if there is more than one person in your house  this game does not work like every other  one full player per console  avoid until fixed 
2251,the whole one island per switch is     completely ruins the game for people in couples or anybody trying have multiple players in the same household  terrible design choice
2252,game was advertised as multiplayer  multiplayer is worse than i could imagine  it is not just poorly done  it is deliberately broken as a design decision  it is mind boggling  and if you wouldo not like it  you cannot even have two users with their own single player game  i got it for two of us  but now i wouldo not play because there is only so much that can be done in a real world day  one player cangame was advertised as multiplayer  multiplayer is worse than i could imagine  it is not just poorly done  it is deliberately broken as a design decision  it is mind boggling  and if you wouldo not like it  you cannot even have two users with their own single player game  i got it for two of us  but now i wouldo not play because there is only so much that can be done in a real world day  one player can use it up  and  this is more a switch complaint  if a user wants to invite a friend to play  that user needs their own nintendo online subscription  i cannot just buy an individual plan for my console  i have to buy a damned family plan  for one console  all of the issues could be trivially fixed  but doing it this way was a deliberate design choice  it pisses me off  expand
2253,this is a beautifully made game with hours to enjoy  but unfortunately nintendo took this awesome game and used it to try and boost their switch sales by forcing households who only have one switch to buy multiple if you are the first person you get to experience everything the game has to offer  there isn t anything you wouldo not have access to  you can get new villagers  build stores this is a beautifully made game with hours to enjoy  but unfortunately nintendo took this awesome game and used it to try and boost their switch sales by forcing households who only have one switch to buy multiple if you are the first person you get to experience everything the game has to offer  there isn t anything you wouldo not have access to  you can get new villagers  build stores  paths  bridges  and even change the landscape to truly make the island yours if you are the second person to play on the console  you get to experience one aspect of animal crossing  you get to make a cool house  that s it  you cannot get new villagers to the island and you cannot build bridges or paths  you might as well be playing as another animal who takes up residence on the island  it isn t your island  you are just a guest the fact that nintendo consciously made the decision to force households to buy multiple consoles if everyone in the household wants to experience all this new game has to offer shows exactly how greedy the company has gotten yes i am fully aware that  as a company  they want to pull in as much profit as possible  but all this decision has done is made consumers angry and against the idea of giving them more money to feed their greed great job creating a wonderful game and ruining it with your greed nintendo  expand
2254,is such a shame not being able to create your own islands  yo cannot even have your own experience trough the game
2255,wow  i wish i would read the reviews before buying this  not having multiple islands on 1 switch has left my daughter in tears and my son defensive about his island  i would not have bought this knowing the problems it was going to cause especially as it was supposed to help during the lock down  poor show nintendo

2260,a slow burn as it usually is with animal crossing and a bit grindy but once in the swing of things its non stop  fully enjoying the freedom that this game gives 
2261,best game ever if you wouldo not have to share your island with anyone  i feel it was designed for people between 25 and 30 years old do not miss this game just because the low ratings due to the one island per console issue  if you live alone you will not regret 
2262,fun relaxing time waisting game  it is a shame that you cannot have more than one island  other wise the game is great 
2263,the best game in the series yet  all the new mechanics are a breath of fresh air for the series

2273,animal crossing new horizons is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing switch game with some minor flaws that hold it back just a bit  the game starts you off from scratch as you have you have to build your own island basically all by yourself with only tom nook s small residential services tent in place to get you started  not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but youanimal crossing new horizons is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing switch game with some minor flaws that hold it back just a bit  the game starts you off from scratch as you have you have to build your own island basically all by yourself with only tom nook s small residential services tent in place to get you started  not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but you also pick the locations of your first 2 villagers as well as future 8 other villagers as in order to keep with the starting from scratch theme you have to find most of your villagers yourself  personally  i really like the idea of starting from scratch as it really feels like i have full control over my island and that everything on it has made because of me the game goes by real time and every single day you have something new to do such as picking fruit from your trees  hitting rocks to get materials such as iron nuggets and filling up your town museum with bugs  fish  and fossils you find  but in order to get buildings such as the museum to access more things you wouldo  tom nook gives you tasks every day to help gain the access to new buildings and functions  the game is very relaxing to me as i can just go day by day slowly building up my town but not having to do everything all at once  it gives me a reason to come back every day the game heavily features a brand new crafting system that use to create almost everything on the island including your own tools  this is where my first small issue is  while the crafting is fantastic and adds to the experience  the tools that you use everyday can break unlike previous animal crossing games and it happens enough to be tedious to have to get the supplies and then re craft them  also kind of sucks is accounts on the same system all have to share an island instead of getting to create their own  online multiplayer is a bit annoying as it has a very sluggish start as you always wait a few minutes for a cut scene to play as a new person arrives and even when they are there functions are limited on the island though while these issues are certainly a pain in the butt at times it istill isn t enough to deter from the lovely relaxing life simulation game that is animal crossing new horizons  if you want something to just relax and play its definitely worth your time8 10  expand

2283,its a great game  a lot of people whiny toddlers  are upset because the lack of a cloud save feature and the fact that your island cant be manipulated to a certain degree  by another player  keep in mind animal crossing has always been a single player time sink  multiplayer was never the selling point so rating the game a zero just because you cant have someone boost your progress in gameits a great game  a lot of people whiny toddlers  are upset because the lack of a cloud save feature and the fact that your island cant be manipulated to a certain degree  by another player  keep in mind animal crossing has always been a single player time sink  multiplayer was never the selling point so rating the game a zero just because you cant have someone boost your progress in game is both ignorant and childish  if you are a legitimate fan of the series you will enjoy the quality of life improvements new horizons brings  but if you obsess over co op play then i guess this game is nothe antichrist according to most reviews on here  expand

2285,no se pueden crear dos islas en la misma consola  por el resto aunque aveces algunas mecánicas son algo tediosas no es nada preocupante excepto lo de que te puedan dar recetas repetidas eso es horrible porque te puedes tirar muchísimo tiempo y no tener una mesita de noche como me ha pasado a mí por ejemplo

2287,there are lots of features taken out of this game from previous games  seems like nintendo really just threw this game together  it is becoming more and more disappointing every day  previous titles have way more content 
2288,i loved this game until it literally made me have a fight with my boyfriend over the 2nd player being a glorified visitor nintendo should either make the resident representative title a transferable one or let one have multiple savefiles with the game  it truly destroyed any positive feelings i had towards this game i would ask for a refund but i cannot go to the store due to the coronavirus
2289,people saying that you can only have one island per switch are being too benevolent  in fact  you can only have one gameplay per switch  the first player account to play will be the resident representative  meaning that he she will have the full gameplay experience  remaining player will not be able to  create an island  name an island  take part in the decisions  e g  make buildings people saying that you can only have one island per switch are being too benevolent  in fact  you can only have one gameplay per switch  the first player account to play will be the resident representative  meaning that he she will have the full gameplay experience  remaining player will not be able to  create an island  name an island  take part in the decisions  e g  make buildings  invite npc  e g  bladders  basically  you can have one player per console  remaining ones are playable residents  nice touch nintendo  specially given the time of release  covid19  expand
2290,this game is completely ruined by the fact you need to have 2 concoles and 2 games to play in the same household  especially when the price for entry is currently over 500 dollars for the console and game because of price gouging

2293,the limitations on anyone other than the initial player are absolutely ridiculous    this was a huge disappointment for me as my wife started the island  one island per switch  and i was left as an ancillary character when i joined in    the game play looked fun when she was playing  such a shame 
2294,nintendo  i have been a fan of your products ever since i was a small boy  and when we purchased animal crossing  me and my brother thought we can have our own islands  but nope you guys restricted it to one island a switch  and restricts the other players from having the same experience  it content lock the second player to what ever the first player was able to accomplish  this ruins thenintendo  i have been a fan of your products ever since i was a small boy  and when we purchased animal crossing  me and my brother thought we can have our own islands  but nope you guys restricted it to one island a switch  and restricts the other players from having the same experience  it content lock the second player to what ever the first player was able to accomplish  this ruins the fun and makes the game boring  so we are returning the game  all of this noto push on people buying a new switch  its a stupid reason  this ruined the experience so much  expand

2298,preface  i have been playing animal crossing since the gamecube game and ac is one of my favorite gaming series of all time  that being said  this game is a bit of a disappointment things i like customizing island via terraforming crafting items as a means of gaining furniture the island tours the graphics the music  ability to place items outside  the fencing systempreface  i have been playing animal crossing since the gamecube game and ac is one of my favorite gaming series of all time  that being said  this game is a bit of a disappointment things i like customizing island via terraforming crafting items as a means of gaining furniture the island tours the graphics the music  ability to place items outside  the fencing system the general gameplay  camera controls inside home happy home designer inspired customization features inside of homethings i wouldo not like very lacking list of obtainable furniture no nintendo items  many missing furniture sets from previous games  the available furniture is uninspired and bland only two stores available  no brewsters  no kicks  no garden store  no ressetti no art  redd  or art wing of museum nooks store only upgrades once cannot buy crafted furniture from catalog  crafting tools is nothing more than an annoyance  golden tools break so there is no point in unlocking them  isabelle telling me absolutely nothing at the beginning of every day  the fish and insects are no longer animated when viewing the fish insect dex  not fish  bug sizes  i have already said this in a way  but having to craft tools every fifteen minutes is maddeningthis game took 2 steps forward with the increased customization of the island outside of one s home  placing furniture outside is great and really changes the game   but this game took 50 steps back with all of the cut material  all in all  its a decent enough game and i have enjoyed my time with it  but i am starting to realize how empty it is  it really just makes me want to go back and play animal crossing new leaf  if i am only going to have two stores anyways  i would rather play wild world being able to customize the island is cool and all  but it really does not make up for losing so much of what has made this franchise great  i hope that more of the cut content is added in the future  if we never get more shops  and nintendo items are not added  i cannot see myself playing this game for very long  i ll likely go back to new leaf or wild world  in those games i absolutely loved getting all the furniture i could in order to make my house as unique and homely as possible  in new horizons i have three rooms  two of which are completely empty because the furniture i have obtained is so boring thanks for reading  expand
2299,the one island is absolutely unacceptable  why could they not give multiple saves  why do i have to share my resources if i want to play with someone else  it makes no sense  and it is ruining the game for me  also having to wait for specific parts of the day  i work and i am very busy more often than not  and the time sensitive specs are enraging when you compare it to the original animalthe one island is absolutely unacceptable  why could they not give multiple saves  why do i have to share my resources if i want to play with someone else  it makes no sense  and it is ruining the game for me  also having to wait for specific parts of the day  i work and i am very busy more often than not  and the time sensitive specs are enraging when you compare it to the original animal crossing where you would just go to sleep  i recommend you just play the original on the gamecube then delve into this game  expand

2301,great game overall  almost a 10  but bogged down slightly by the  1 island per switch  problem  though not directly affecting me  i know that the issue has worsened the experience for others 
2302,this is very addictive and colorful game with awfully slow dialogue system  horrible online multiplayer  looks like developers have not heard of internet existing  if 7 if your friends will visit your island be ready to spend about a half an hour just to arrival animation  in the end i love animal crossing but horrible online  unskippable dialogues  lack of cloud saves etc drive me mad this is very addictive and colorful game with awfully slow dialogue system  horrible online multiplayer  looks like developers have not heard of internet existing  if 7 if your friends will visit your island be ready to spend about a half an hour just to arrival animation  in the end i love animal crossing but horrible online  unskippable dialogues  lack of cloud saves etc drive me mad do not buy it  expand
2303,the game lacks the feature of cloud saving or  at least  transferring progress between consoles  as someone who is going to be playing this game a lot and wishes to upgrade to a better  more expensive console  this is horrible  people will refuse to upgrade consoles just because of the progress on their islands 
2304,give second players more freedom  i understand that the reason that they built the game this way was that they want people to connect  so i can actually accept why they had people share an island  but why does the progression need to be dependent only on the 1st player  it ruins the experience for the other players 
2305,disappointing that families that share a switch cannot have their own save file and island  my wife started the game  so i wouldo not even bother playing since my experience will be arbitrarily constrained by nintendo  mind boggling decision by them  user accounts exist for a reason  hope they fix it isoon 
2306,one island per console  meaning only one user gets the first playing experience  on a  59 game  you must be crazy 
2307,created a metacritic account only to rate this half of a game  it is disappointing when you have to read a faq to find out about the one island per console issue  this is a fantastic game for whoever plays first  but i have to drop it 5 points for for this one issue alone  i can only see my youngest getting frustrated he cannot do certain things without getting on the oldest ones account created a metacritic account only to rate this half of a game  it is disappointing when you have to read a faq to find out about the one island per console issue  this is a fantastic game for whoever plays first  but i have to drop it 5 points for for this one issue alone  i can only see my youngest getting frustrated he cannot do certain things without getting on the oldest ones account  i am new to animal crossing  and apparently this holds true to formula  but this is a nintendo switch  utilize it is potential and make separate islands we can all have freedom to make our own decisions on  if you want to stick to the one island  make it iso each island is linked to each other  separated by rivers  and later accessable using bridges  major oversight in console gaming and it is obvious the community isn t happy  time to switch up the formula on the switch devs  pretty sure this will be a one and done for our household  expand

2321,fun game for the first player to arrive on the island  if anyone else in the household plays  they are essentially a meaningless npc that is unable to impact the story in any meaningful way  terrible design decision that i hope they will reverse the game itself is fun for the most part  even if it feels like it needs more variety after a while  it is clearly a game to just have funfun game for the first player to arrive on the island  if anyone else in the household plays  they are essentially a meaningless npc that is unable to impact the story in any meaningful way  terrible design decision that i hope they will reverse the game itself is fun for the most part  even if it feels like it needs more variety after a while  it is clearly a game to just have fun with and if i could actually play the game properly  it might be fun for me  my wife is enjoying it  primary player  though  multiplayer aspect is incredibly shallow too  i expected more from that i would say if nintendo reverses their boneheaded single island move  it could be winner but they have sold a bajillion copies of it and likely dont care  nintendo   tom nook  expand

2331,thia game has caused nothing but grief in my house because of the 1 island per switch rule
2332,the fact that you can only have one island per switch console is a huge downer  i wanted to play the game independantly from my family  because i am a mega sweat player  but i cannot  because whoever played the game first is basically lord supreme dictator of the island i will happily revise my review upon further changes  but my experience with the game feels like something out of athe fact that you can only have one island per switch console is a huge downer  i wanted to play the game independantly from my family  because i am a mega sweat player  but i cannot  because whoever played the game first is basically lord supreme dictator of the island i will happily revise my review upon further changes  but my experience with the game feels like something out of a pay to win mobile game regards  expand
2333,awfull nintendo game and the one island policy is a shame do not buy this game if u plan to play as a familly do not   it is just a problems maker the happy familly theme is just a front the marketing is a  real disgrace money makers gonne too far once again refund will be on his way 
2334,the fact that i would have to buy a second switch to get the same game experience as my wife is   i could accept having to buy a separate copy of the game  but a second console  completely unacceptable 
2335,is my entire family supposed to buy one switch each to play this game  this is literally insane and should be illegal  shame on you nintendo  wish i could return my switch  never buying a product from you again 
2336,bought this game for my gf  bored and try to play it myself   see that nintendo added an arbitrary restriction of one island per console  this is blatant anti consumerism and is an obvious cash grab to sell more consoles  nintendo has lost a customer  i will never again give a cent to this company that could not even respect me as a consumer 
2337,for a game that s about making friends and togetherness  the game isolates everyone besides the primary player  no one can do anything important besides the primary player such as building important bridges or new houses  why  it would be fine if there were more things to do but there isn t  exploring seemingly random islands and trying to get the biggest payout for every trip can only befor a game that s about making friends and togetherness  the game isolates everyone besides the primary player  no one can do anything important besides the primary player such as building important bridges or new houses  why  it would be fine if there were more things to do but there isn t  exploring seemingly random islands and trying to get the biggest payout for every trip can only be done so many times before i get burnt out  decorating can only get me so far and from what i have heard there are apparently not many furniture options to decorate with  i want to build a town and see new faces besides the two villagers my wife and i first started out with but i cannot do anything  there is no point in being a secondary player in this animal crossing  if the secondary player chops trees or mines rocks it renders those resources empty for other players for a while  taking away their resources  besides that  another huge issue i have with the game is optimization issues  why do i have to eat one orange at a time  why not give an option to eat a certain number of food items at one time without having to click over and over again and give it a slightly longer animation  the same thing happens with releasing fish  you need to go into your pockets  click on the fish  click release  this for some reason takes you out of the menu to play the same tired animation  chances are you have more than one thing you want to drop to empty out your limited inventory so you end up going into your inventory several times and it takes way longer than it ishould  this game does everything in its power to waste your time like clicking through dozens of text boxes to donate anything for instance  it is such bad design that it makes me not want to play it anymore and it would not matter since secondary players do not matter anyway  expand
2338,i am playing with my wife and as she is nothe primary player  i lost the interest in game on the third day  i wouldo not want to play it as there is absolutely nothing to do  than fishing and expanding the house  any other catchy moments are just spent by the primary player makes 0 point to play it together and it is a shame nintendo you pushing  to buy the second console in that dirty way i am playing with my wife and as she is nothe primary player  i lost the interest in game on the third day  i wouldo not want to play it as there is absolutely nothing to do  than fishing and expanding the house  any other catchy moments are just spent by the primary player makes 0 point to play it together and it is a shame nintendo you pushing  to buy the second console in that dirty way  it is a cheap move  expand
2339,i thought i would like this game as i am a very big fan of stardew valley which has a lot of similar elements to animal crossing  the problem i ran into over and over while playing this was how strikingly tedious  dull  and repetitive everything is   and for very little payoff
2340,my girlfriend and i was looking forward to have our own islands and help eachother out  1 island per switch is absolute   luckily i told a lot of people about this and they passed om the game    off nintendo

2342,as if being quarantined in real life was not enough  the creators thought it was appropriate to quarantine you with your household in the game as well  and it gets worse  they implemented dictator rules so only the first person to play actually gets to enjoy the game fully like making choices and advancing in the game while everyone else at most is a supporting character by force  theyas if being quarantined in real life was not enough  the creators thought it was appropriate to quarantine you with your household in the game as well  and it gets worse  they implemented dictator rules so only the first person to play actually gets to enjoy the game fully like making choices and advancing in the game while everyone else at most is a supporting character by force  they do not even get a tutorial on how to play  absolutely the most anti family friendly move from a family friendly console  trash game  expand

2345,i wouldo not get what this obsession is with new horizons  it is boring  i bought it because i thought it would be fun the share the experience with my girlfriend  but it really is just so dull
2346,i was having fun playing this game  until my partner decided he wanted to play it too  unfortunately there are no separate save files  so he has to play on an island that i control  where i have already picked over all of the resources  any subsequent players get no money  no resources and no control  this is not a family friendly game 
2347,we are a family of 5 with 3 young kids who were so excited about this game  we let our 4 year old kick things off and then to our horror after playing for about a week puzzled why nothing was happening   realized he was the only one who could actually play the full game  now no one is playing because what s the point  100  would not recommend for any families  it is a terrible set up 
2348,i really enjoyed getting into the game  until i realized that i cannot progress until my 8 year old daughter completes certain tasks since she created her account first   what in the world was nintendo thinking   when will this be fixed   how is it that you can sell a game but not allow all players to progress on their own   completely ridiculous on nintendo s part 
2349,bad option from nintendo to disable the 2 player  i practically play as a visitor to the island  i wouldo not have any weight and i cannot even have an island of mine even though i bought the console and the game  horrible  sad  discouraging  bad buy to play with my brother  ridiculous gameplay

2355,actually  the best animal crossing ever made the only bad thing here is nothe bad multiplayer system 
2356,no había jugado un título de animal crossing antes y quería darla la oportunidad a este por el hype  no puedo dejar de jugarlo  la personalización de lo que puedes hacer con la isla y con los objetos de ella es inmensa  se te hace rutina querer jugar para no perderte de los objetos  diarios  pensé que me aburriría pero no  es un juego muy bonito 
2357,it is a brilliant and great game that builds and expands on the amazing success it has had in prior iterations  yes there are a few mechanical functions that can be fixed to make gameplay more fluent but that aside this game is brilliant 
2358,do not buy this game if you plan on using it for local multiplayer  meaning more than one use in the same household i cannot stress this enough as it will cause you no end of frustration  headaches  angry crying and resentment   i say this for the simple fact that there is no true multiplayer function that will satisfy everything within the game   the only person that has any say ordo not buy this game if you plan on using it for local multiplayer  meaning more than one use in the same household i cannot stress this enough as it will cause you no end of frustration  headaches  angry crying and resentment   i say this for the simple fact that there is no true multiplayer function that will satisfy everything within the game   the only person that has any say or control or can actually do anything worthwhile is nothe very first person to start playing the game on the console  everyone else is literally just a slave to their whims   i cannot even sugar coat it because it is caused no end of anger and frustration for my partner and i when we have tried to play together   they lost all interest as they literally could not progress the story  gain diy recipes from tom nook  nor actually make any meaningful decisions within the island  such as placing residents or setting up bridges or really doing anything of note at all   they have stopped playing entirely and that has killed my joy as i ll never be able to play with them all due to nintendo s greed   for a company that stresses being the best multiplayer and family friendly console on the market they sure did a good job of tearing families apart with this notitle   like they have got great multiplayer function in almost every other game  yet decided to go money hungry with this entry for whatever reason   locking each switch to 1 island  even if you have multiple id s with multiple online ability  and even with multiple game codes purchased  is just terrible restrictive and straight up greedy  and i say this as they have yet to offer a valid reason for restricting it in this way so i can only make my own inferences understand that i am not really upset at locking the switch to 1 island per switch  that actually makes some sense to me   the reason for the review being this low is nothe fact that they advertise this game as a family friendly game  which it is clearly not  what is fun about being relegated to a servant of the first person to start the game   if they simply added a function to change the resident representative in game then none of us would have reviewed this with such vehemence think about this   if this game was purchased for a household with multiple kids or in a house with multiple roommates that all love the ac series and looked forward to playing this  if for whatever reason the  main  person who started playing  not even the one who actually bought it because they do not restrict it to actual accounts  was not able to play for an extended period of time  either due to illness  or they were stuck in quarantine at a different location  or they simply stopped playing  then you have effectively killed all progress and joy for the remaining members of that household   no one will be able to move the game forward so long as that player never plays again   that is why we are all distraught over nintendo s decision  and have every right to rate this game as such   nintendo never shed any light on this  because had a parent of children  or partner in a relationship known that the others they live with will never have the same ability or privileges across the board then they would not have purchased it in the first place   why cause strife intentionally when we are already dealing with everything else going on in the world so i write this review  not to review bomb  but as a warning for all future purchasers to beware of what they will be getting themselves into now that i have said that  to validate my review i will state that until we discovered this noterrible game design decision  it was a really fun and enjoyable game to play  but i will not rate it higher than a 1 until nintendo even acknowledges this issue let alone be proactive and fix it    a 1 because there was enjoyment at one point  but now no longer  expand

2360,the game is good  but not the better animal crossing ever made  have a lot of hours of fun and it is very good
2361,simply incredible  i love this game  in my opinioni is nothe most complete totale ever of the brand
2362,to be the second player who boots the game is noto have a worse game  i cannot believe this is how the game should be played  you cannot do anything as the second player this is equivalent of getting the mad catz controller when gaming as a child  this is a game for lonely people only  if you live with someone and share a switch  do not even bother  you cannot even return digitally bought games 
2363,have owned this game a few days now and the single player is fun  though a little slow to ramp up  i wouldo not mind the progression  though  as a parent i only have limited time to play it anyway  my main gripe is nothe same as everyone else reviewing this game poorly   the decision to lock each switch to one island  previous games may have done this  but save files were treated differently whenhave owned this game a few days now and the single player is fun  though a little slow to ramp up  i wouldo not mind the progression  though  as a parent i only have limited time to play it anyway  my main gripe is nothe same as everyone else reviewing this game poorly   the decision to lock each switch to one island  previous games may have done this  but save files were treated differently when they were stored on cartridges  this was a design choice when i played the original game  i remember another family member and i were both able to play and have fun  reading about the functionality for multiple players now  though  i wouldo not feel like it is even worth inviting someone else to play  it iseems like a lot of features  even beyond being able to place buildings and such  which it makes sense to restrict to one person  are missing for succeeding players so if you are alone  this is a great game  if you want something for multiple people to play  it is disappointing  expand

2365,would be great if nintendo actually put effort into online multilayer they really dropped the ball
2366,my partner and i purchased this not inexpensive game and are saddened to see that only 1 of us can have an island  1 island per switch  the other can have their own character and live there too  but the experience is not comparable  i was really looking forward to playing this game but i am unable to do so properly  i wouldo not even bother playing as the secondary character as the experiencemy partner and i purchased this not inexpensive game and are saddened to see that only 1 of us can have an island  1 island per switch  the other can have their own character and live there too  but the experience is not comparable  i was really looking forward to playing this game but i am unable to do so properly  i wouldo not even bother playing as the secondary character as the experience is so lacking  and seeing what my partner is achieving just adds emphasises this so  my rating is 0 as nintendo have basically said that unless i am willing  or more importantly  able  to purchase a second switch  i cannot play  i am not willing or able to and i imagine this is nothe same for most switch owners  expand
2367,one island per console   if there was the ability to have more than one island per console i would say this game is a 9 or a 10  but this forced island sharing is nothe one of the most obvious examples of corporate greed i have ever seen 
2368,i had never played animal crossing before  i bought the game yesterday and was really excited to play  my boyfriend was the one to play first  and when it was my turn that s when i found out you can only have one island per console  even worse  the secondary player cannot even access all of the features in the game which makes the gameplay dependent on the primary player to progress  ii had never played animal crossing before  i bought the game yesterday and was really excited to play  my boyfriend was the one to play first  and when it was my turn that s when i found out you can only have one island per console  even worse  the secondary player cannot even access all of the features in the game which makes the gameplay dependent on the primary player to progress  i think this is absolute   and a very greedy move by nintendo  i want to enjoy this game  but this makes it literally impossible  hope you will change this asap  or i ll seriously reconsider supporting your now greedy company in the future  expand
2369,we were so excited for this game  so much so we purchased 2 switches and 2 copies of animal crossing  we promptly returned the unopened game and are looking to gift the opened version to a 4 year old  because that s how much it is worth  absolutely boring game that is a waste of time and money 
2370,my wife and i purchased this game  i started an island  next thing i knew my wife started an island  low and behold she joined my island  stupid design  i have played about 2 hours while my wife has played about 20 hours and cannot progress without me going on and unlocking stuff because we share an island  equivalent of a  10 game  not worth  60  not worth buying for multiplayer  not worthmy wife and i purchased this game  i started an island  next thing i knew my wife started an island  low and behold she joined my island  stupid design  i have played about 2 hours while my wife has played about 20 hours and cannot progress without me going on and unlocking stuff because we share an island  equivalent of a  10 game  not worth  60  not worth buying for multiplayer  not worth a good review because the design of the game is so poorly done  expand
2371,only 1 players can play the game  others can just follow  so if more people play the game you need more nintendos  55 euro for a gamne only 1 player can play is a ripoff 
2372,ok  it is fine having just an island and sharing with my sister  it is not so cool being forced to share all the resources  but it is totally awful that the player 2 cannot do anything to the island  unable to build bridges  new homes and also roads  that completely ruined the experience  my sister does not want to play anymore and maybe me neither
2373,come on  really  multiple switches required  what a cash grab  hopefully this   will catch up with nintendo sooner or later 
2374,dear nintendo   and anyone who reads this ive been a fan of nintendos consoles and games my whole life  i had pretty much every console that came out after i was born and i loved them one of my most loved games was animal crossing  i played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day  of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out anddear nintendo   and anyone who reads this ive been a fan of nintendos consoles and games my whole life  i had pretty much every console that came out after i was born and i loved them one of my most loved games was animal crossing  i played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day  of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out and played it isadly new horizons is why i actually write to you guys for the first time the game looks good and the crafting is fun but the game feels empty  unfinished and lacking  it feels like the bare bone basics of any animal crossing before it and thats it  the multiplayer is seriously lacking and that is for an console that has heavily been marketed as something to play together just unacceptable  local multiplayer is pretty much just running behind someone and waiting for them to do something   the most i can do with the ones quarantined with me is collecting wood while one hits the trees and the other one picks it up and the worst thing is it does not even go to that persons inventory but to that dumb chest  it does not feel like you wouldid or archived anything as the second player  you cant progress and since the game is so empty and the only thing to do is progress means the game is pretty much worthless if you are the second player the online multiplayer is better but still boring after a few times there isn t much to do with the person so it is mostly just repeating everything you have done that morning on your island on another  i cant imagine why you would go back a step from new leaf there you knew already that there needed to be more for multiplayer and tried to add something but the worst for me is nothat as far as i can see ive already  finished  the game  my main motivations to play regularly in previous games were to build out my house completely  to build out the stores and get all the stores and then at last to make my town look pretty  those where the long time goals  the big goals that stood over the smaller ones ive already almost completely build out my house because there is nothing else to do in this game than grind for money in comparison it took me years to get to this stage in previous installments because there was so much more to do as far as i can see ive already hit the top on the nook shop  there does not seem to be another upgrade as far as the internet cannotell me and the only thing thats left is making my town pretty and im already almost perfectly happy with everything on that front when i started this game it felt abit boring at first because there was not much to do right at the beginning it was slow  something that already put off one of my friends that bought the game   then after it picked up a bit i was so glad because i thought this was going to become great  but now after such short time i already have done what i can do and the daily chores have become kinda meaningless even if in updates you guys add stuff that had already been in previous  games what motivation do i have to not play around with it for alittle bit and then put it down again  my town is already build all around the limited buildings that are in the game now  getting rid of everything and terraforming it again will be a chore and will probably make any much needed content thats added less enjoyable and when you guys now slowly add the stuff that should have been in it from the beginning will you even bother to put in something new it makes me so sad and angry to leave such a bad review on the game  because i love the game  i love the characters and im sure the people who worked on it put their heart into it  the items look gorgeous the characters and environments too  but the game is empty and it feels like there was not enough time so it got sold unfinished in the hopes that nobody would play through the first part before it could get fixed up into an actual game and it pains me so much to say this but i wouldont know if its worth the money it costs i wont be telling my friends to buy it  maybe ill tell them to wait until it actually gets made into a full game  i hear all the time that it will probably get updates that will ad in more  but for me putting out a game that feels unfinished is unacceptable  updates shouldnt be there to make it a complete game but to add extra stuff to expand the lifetime of a game im more than disappointed im heartbroken i hope this gets to the ones who can actually change anything about animal crossing  the strategy that is currently used on this game  expand
2375,as many people have mentioned  this game might be fine for a one person household but for any more it is awful  second or later players cannot do hardly anything and everyone is stuck on the same small island  only the primary player gets any significant control  everyone else gets a highly inferior experience  you can have only one player per switch  which is ridiculous  no matter how muchas many people have mentioned  this game might be fine for a one person household but for any more it is awful  second or later players cannot do hardly anything and everyone is stuck on the same small island  only the primary player gets any significant control  everyone else gets a highly inferior experience  you can have only one player per switch  which is ridiculous  no matter how much fun this looks  it is in no way a  360 game  which is what buying the switch and game will cost you  do not buy this game  spend it on something else  perhaps with actual decent value  expand
2376,one island per switch is a f n stupid idea  should have option to have each save file  only player one can really play the game
2377,i bought this game just to play the whole family  but this is impossible my son created the island and now i cannot do anything new  if my son does not play nintendo  this is a bad thing  
2378,most people have already noted that nintendo botched the initial setup for this game  you can only create one island per console  that seems insane  but that s been known for some time i still would ve reviewed the game a bit better than most  but after playing through their first event  it is clear nintendo has no idea what they re doing  they launch and promote the cherry blossommost people have already noted that nintendo botched the initial setup for this game  you can only create one island per console  that seems insane  but that s been known for some time i still would ve reviewed the game a bit better than most  but after playing through their first event  it is clear nintendo has no idea what they re doing  they launch and promote the cherry blossom event and talk about obtaining recipes  encouraging you to catch petals to create cool cherry blossom related items   then they make the recipes nearly impossible to obtain  you could farm balloons hoping for recipes for hours and come away with one or two  how is nothis fun or interesting  what an awful  awful event the cutesy graphics and adorable sound effects and music basically mask a completely broken game mechanic leading to wasted time and disappointment  expand
2379,this is it  i am not buying any more nintendo products  the co op in this game is just ridiculous  forcing people to buy more consoles the greed is disgusting  this is so anti consumer i played until the kk slider concert  i would have enjoyed the game if it did not have the stupid multiplayer restrictions i never have to deal with this level of crap with other consoles  it isucks causethis is it  i am not buying any more nintendo products  the co op in this game is just ridiculous  forcing people to buy more consoles the greed is disgusting  this is so anti consumer i played until the kk slider concert  i would have enjoyed the game if it did not have the stupid multiplayer restrictions i never have to deal with this level of crap with other consoles  it isucks cause i really loved nintendo franchises  but they cannot keep on doing this  expand

2384,i think 1 island 1 switch is amazing game design  something i heard from a japanese friend  seems true but need to double check  is nothat one of the creators would always get home from work late  probably because of japan s insane working hours  anyways  their kids would be asleep  and they wish they could game with them  so they thought  what if there was a game where they could gamei think 1 island 1 switch is amazing game design  something i heard from a japanese friend  seems true but need to double check  is nothat one of the creators would always get home from work late  probably because of japan s insane working hours  anyways  their kids would be asleep  and they wish they could game with them  so they thought  what if there was a game where they could game together  even if not at the same time  and i think that is nothe inspiration for the shared island game design  even when one isn t playing  you can see traces of their play session or they can leave nice messages  etc the game is literally called  animal forest  come together  in japanese  it is about working and building an island together  isolating each switch user on a desert island goes against that principle  of course that isn t a feature  people that accuse nintendo of making a cash grab are missing the point entirely  they are the type that like to characterize companies as big  money grabbing entities  without thinking maybe  just maybe  these talented developers might have made those design decisions for other reasons  it iseems to me many western gamers feel entitled and want every feature exactly how they want it people be so angry and review bombing left and right  a single design feature they do not like does not warrant rating this gem a 0  did you not read about 1 island 1 switch before buying the game anyways  amazing game  fun  beautiful  polished  engaging 10 10  switch must play  expand
2385,my girlfriend started before me on my switch so now i basically cannot play it the limitations put on all other players are unreasonable  do not expect to have any fun as any player but the main player  the second player to join an island cannot so much as craft a flimsy axe or craft a watering can  you pretty much cannot play if you are not the player that created the island  1 island permy girlfriend started before me on my switch so now i basically cannot play it the limitations put on all other players are unreasonable  do not expect to have any fun as any player but the main player  the second player to join an island cannot so much as craft a flimsy axe or craft a watering can  you pretty much cannot play if you are not the player that created the island  1 island per switch is nothe most insane limitation nintendo has ever published  expand
2386,my first ac and i have an amazing time playing it  i can understand the bad mood about the island limitation  though 
2387,come on nintendo  worst decision ever that a second player is just a glorified npc  not gonna fork out for another switch just so my family members can play the game 
2388,wow wish i could play but i wouldo not want to share the same island as  my roommates so i guess i am sol  waited this long and spent  60 for nothing  do not purchase or support this game until a fix is released
2389,the other user reviews are correct  the insane design decision of having one island per switch has effectively killed multiplayer for this game  you simply feel like a guest on someone else s island  and if the player who registered the island stops playing all gameplay progression comes grinding to a halt  potentially causing you to lose many hours of work  in addition to that i foundthe other user reviews are correct  the insane design decision of having one island per switch has effectively killed multiplayer for this game  you simply feel like a guest on someone else s island  and if the player who registered the island stops playing all gameplay progression comes grinding to a halt  potentially causing you to lose many hours of work  in addition to that i found single player rather pointless and cumbersome  selecting tools  crafting  managing your inventory are all much more of a chore than they should be  the npc s are all very boring  just wandering around all day and coming out with the same stock answers  crafting your own furniture and items is pointless if you cannot actually interact with them  what s the point of crafting a musical instrument if you cannot use it  why bother with a mirror if you cannot see your reflection  instead you just spend your time gathering resources  it is not that i wouldislike games of this genre  per se  but with animal crossing you start off on such a tiny island with so little to do that s interesting i am really struggling to see why there are so many glowing reviews  stardew valley is a hundred times better than this meagre offering and that s an indie game developed by one person  expand
2390,it is a glorified mobile game with the worst base building gameplay i have ever seen  the point is you are supposed to be able to build your island how you want  yet it is ridiculously restrictive  a key feature is noto alter terrain  when does that unlock  after the story is done  well after it would have been relevant to have then we get into the play  and wait aspects of the game  mostit is a glorified mobile game with the worst base building gameplay i have ever seen  the point is you are supposed to be able to build your island how you want  yet it is ridiculously restrictive  a key feature is noto alter terrain  when does that unlock  after the story is done  well after it would have been relevant to have then we get into the play  and wait aspects of the game  most just turn the clocks on their system forward since it is all real time  all that proves is a severe lack of content it is one of those things where i laugh because people are complaining about only being able to have 1 island  you can only have 1 island  because it is a mobile game  it was not made to be good  it was made to make money  so if you want to know who is ruining video games  it is the fans  they do not care if it is bad  they just want more  it is nintendo  yeah  it is nintendo who is notaking advantage of your wallet  expand
2391,fun game  one island is ridiculous  only 1 player gets like 95  of the game  the other 7 miss out on a lot or cannot progress further  absolute moronic  the 2 is for the fact we planned to play together on one switch  undoable  a higher rating would ve been given if i planned to stay alone 
2392,i got this game expecting both my girlfriend and i to enjoy it  i absolutely loved the game and spent countless hours on it  my girlfriend played separately on their account  then we got to talking about it one day and i find out that not only was i forced to move on the island already created when i started  there are goals and parts of the game i wouldid not even know existed and could noti got this game expecting both my girlfriend and i to enjoy it  i absolutely loved the game and spent countless hours on it  my girlfriend played separately on their account  then we got to talking about it one day and i find out that not only was i forced to move on the island already created when i started  there are goals and parts of the game i wouldid not even know existed and could not access because i was not the first person to happen to play the game  i spent my money to only be able to play part of a game  i wouldo not understand why they cannot just be like every other game with save files and not take my freedom to play away  expand
2393,do not waste your money if you share your switch with anyone  the game has a terrible multiplayer design  there is only one island allowed per switch  with all the players who did not originally start the island not having nearly as much power as the one who started the island  all other players have no ability to move forward in the story and must wait for the main player to do so  thedo not waste your money if you share your switch with anyone  the game has a terrible multiplayer design  there is only one island allowed per switch  with all the players who did not originally start the island not having nearly as much power as the one who started the island  all other players have no ability to move forward in the story and must wait for the main player to do so  the only way to get around this problem is noto buy a new switch and a new copy of the game  this is something nintendo set up just to scam people out of way more money than the game is actually worth  greedy pigs  i amean  80 for a game that only one person can play and that somewhat resembles a game i could buy on my phone for a couple bucks  do not waste your money on this scam  expand
2394,one island per switch  smh  this needs to change  this is why this game is rated 5
2395,yes i am the 2nd player  the glorified visitor  the meaningless additional resident only spending time fishing  catching bugs and stuff without giving an impact to the story 
2396,i have been a fan of the animal crossing series for a long time  i had the gamecube when i was little and i still carry my 3ds in my bag  i wanted an app long before an ac app even went into consideration and as soon as the switch came out i waited  and waited  and here it finally is  beautiful graphics  wonderful old characters  amazing new mechanics  a perfect game  as expected  if youi have been a fan of the animal crossing series for a long time  i had the gamecube when i was little and i still carry my 3ds in my bag  i wanted an app long before an ac app even went into consideration and as soon as the switch came out i waited  and waited  and here it finally is  beautiful graphics  wonderful old characters  amazing new mechanics  a perfect game  as expected  if you live alone  some people are saying that nintendo did this out of greed but i wonder if it was not to try and force a style of gameplay on us they want us to use  if so  it is childish and controlling and petty  if not  then yeah  it is greedy  people are not happy with this not because we cannot get along and learn to coexist  but because exploring individual freedoms are what creativity  and therefore this game  are all about  i let my boyfriend play instead  i have already had many great experiences and i wanted this one to be for him  but after 275 dollars for the switch and then 60 for the game  i should not have to sacrifice like that  nintendo has a pretty solid track record of having great ideas and then ruining them  and you would think that because of the switch shortage from the virus that this would be as good a time as ever for nintendo to let it go and let us have our own islands since no one can really find or afford another 300 dollar console to play on  not that they should have to  i am surprised people have not resorted to stealing them out of spite  even if nintendo had the dignity and wisdom to fix this mistake  the game is still ruined for me  that first time experience of opening up the game and discovering all it has to offer was smeared the first time i logged in as player two  i ll never have that back  i feel resentful and angry and disappointed  i keep seeing other people play their games on my social media feed and it is frustrating  i am missing out on the sakura trees  i am missing out on the festivals and the seasons and my birthday is in early may  i had at least hoped this game would allievate the stress of being an essential worker on my birthday but i guess not  expand

2404,i have to say i am disappointed  as a fan of animal crossing new leaf  new horizon canceled so many things that are good from previous version  the coffee shop  the numerous dialog for villagers etc  new horizon for me is like animal crossing pocket camp  it lost the spirit of previous animal crossing

2424,es mi primer juego de toda la saga y me deja flipado la cantidad de cosas que hay por hacer todos los días  y a horas distintas del día incluso puede resultar cansado el hecho de tener que meterte todos los días o tener que estar pendientes x días de la semana para comprar cosas o esperar a que llegue alguien lo veo muy muy recomendable para mayores y niños pd  tom nook ladrón

2430,there is a lot of negative reviews complaining about the lack of ability to create your own unique island  now whilst this is an incredibly valid issue with this game  i realise it may not apply to a large subset of players  on the other side there is a lot of very high marks from people that do not care about that i felt i wanted to give a more full summary and review of this game  tothere is a lot of negative reviews complaining about the lack of ability to create your own unique island  now whilst this is an incredibly valid issue with this game  i realise it may not apply to a large subset of players  on the other side there is a lot of very high marks from people that do not care about that i felt i wanted to give a more full summary and review of this game  to give those that probably sit in the middle of not being a long time fan  and having played this game for the first time  like me  i have put in roughly 50 hours into this game  with only 2 days of time travel done at the beginning to speed up the nothing you can do in the first 2 3 days of owning this game effectively  the good parts  nintendo  as always are very good at creating charming worlds  filled with lovely character  and look really nice  the graphics are wonderful to behold  one fo the best aspects of this game in my particular view is nothe designing as pects  there is a lot of items and a lot of ways they can be utilised to make unique little biomes for yourself to enjoy and feel creative  i had a lot of fun organising my house beyond that though  there really is not a whole lot to do  once you ve built the shop museum and got a few rooms of your house  this game gets insanely repetitive  the game becomes  pick fruit  fish a little  dig your 4 fossills which  you run out of unique ones super quick  hit isome rocks  and buy some of the new clothes  slowly making money to add a new room to your house  it is rinse and repeat of that  for about an hour every day as once you ve completed that routine  there is nothing else to do the big thing is nothat i was doing all of that  to get the terraforming  i spent an hour a day doing this repetitive nonsense so i could terraform and really make the island my own  when i finally got terraforming  i finally had to go  yep that s enough for me see here is nothe big major issue with this game  the repetitive stuff  lots of people can look past  they find it relaxing and stress free  a nice mindless task to focus on and remove the pressures of life from  me  i wouldo not really get it  i like being creative  so that s why i stuck to it  the thing is nothough  that nintendo seem to be stuck in the early 90 s when it comes to game mechanics  there are so many barriers in the way of you trying to enjoy this game to the best of its ability  the constant repetition of dialogue  the inability to organise your inventory properly  the inability to build more than one item at a time  or buy more than one item at a time  which is annoying in the nook atm machine  but ten thousand times worse when at the abel sisters house and you have to keep walking in and out of the dressing room if you want more than 1 shirt at a time  the seemingly no reason for why trees wont grow  the multiplayer is gimped hard too  nintendo and internet simply do not work  you want a friend to come over  cool  go to the airport and open your gates  hidden behind 10 mintues worth of dialogue  jesus christ nintendo  allow me to have my gates open at all times  or at least allow my friends to request to come over through the use of the nook phone  a quick invite and join system through the phone  but no  it is a whole infuriating process  even after they have visited the first time and become a best friend  either nintendo are incredibly incompetent at game qol  or they know how to fix these things and do not in order to artificially increase game time  because they know how little actual game play there is in this game terraforming  is without a doubt one of the most poorly implemented mechanics i have seen nintendo create  and i genuinely do not know if this game was actually tested properly  because it is a joke  there is no marker for where you are creating  and it will constantly  and randomly  without any logic choose a different square to work on  regardless of if you wouldo the same action  on top of that  you will either fill land in  or remove land  with the exact same button  use the rest of the buttons nintendo  one for filling one for removing land  how insanely hard is nothat to think of  forcing you to work several times on the same squares because of the lack of any guidance and logic to the system  this game reeks if eitehr laziness or incompetence  i wouldo not know which  and i wouldo not much care  but this game is not even close to being perfect  and has a lot of work needing to be done on it to make it beyond a 6 10 tldr  had some fun with creating  but there are way too many terrible ui game mechanics  and repetitive annoying dialogue to allow me to think it is a good game  expand
2431,not the type of game to play for long hours  enjoyed playing with my wife since it allows multiplayer using the same switch
2432,i liked the game itself  but like the others  i am upset that only one user can play the game normally   the one who first enters the game  and this does not even displays anywhere  is nothis such a way to earn more on people  we have already come to terms with the fact that there is only one island on one console  so to speak  for the rallying of the family  but the same rallying of thei liked the game itself  but like the others  i am upset that only one user can play the game normally   the one who first enters the game  and this does not even displays anywhere  is nothis such a way to earn more on people  we have already come to terms with the fact that there is only one island on one console  so to speak  for the rallying of the family  but the same rallying of the family is not work because of only one user can play normally  nintendo  this is just unfair  expand

2434,my sister and i both use the switch and it is infuriating how much of a stark difference there is  she does not play as much as me but wanted the game so she played first  now every single day i have to wait for her and let her do everything first so she can unlock me the necessary items  she puts buildings in random locations while i like more organized things and it is not fair that wemy sister and i both use the switch and it is infuriating how much of a stark difference there is  she does not play as much as me but wanted the game so she played first  now every single day i have to wait for her and let her do everything first so she can unlock me the necessary items  she puts buildings in random locations while i like more organized things and it is not fair that we spent 100s on a switch and 60 on the game and i cannot even experience it fully  completely ruined the games experience for me as i cannot unlock anything  cannot move anything   cannot place buildings and inclines   and cannot even talk to tom nook the same way  expand

2437,fix the one island problem  it is so frustrating that only one person can make progress in the game
2438,if you have more than one child then for the sake of your sanity do not buy this game  you can only have 1 island and the first player to start the game is nothe only player with access to all crafting recipes and able to progress the game  all other players are there to only assist and cannot have their own island  it is either a terrible design choice or intended to force parents toif you have more than one child then for the sake of your sanity do not buy this game  you can only have 1 island and the first player to start the game is nothe only player with access to all crafting recipes and able to progress the game  all other players are there to only assist and cannot have their own island  it is either a terrible design choice or intended to force parents to purchase additional consoles and copies  either way it is not acceptable and the issues it would cause in households should have been foreseen  if you are buying this for yourself or have an only child the game is great  otherwise it is one to avoid  as unfortunate as this is  expand

2442,great game  obviously  what ruining it to me is limiting one island per console  it is such a low move  it is money grabbing to me and it ruins the experience for families with one console  it is sad that people are being forced to buy another nintendo console to experience the game fully

2444,my kids are devastated  they are relegated to npcs essentially since my oldest is nothe  founder  one island per switch is a pure cash grab by nintendo to sell more switch consoles 
2445,general game is ok  but multiplayer is probably the worst i ever seen  seems it is a nintendo desperate try to force people to buy more consoles  that is super unfair  in summary if more than one people is willing to play in the same console i wish you good luck as this game is a single player game  per console  not per user  all the main activities and real fun are tied to the firstgeneral game is ok  but multiplayer is probably the worst i ever seen  seems it is a nintendo desperate try to force people to buy more consoles  that is super unfair  in summary if more than one people is willing to play in the same console i wish you good luck as this game is a single player game  per console  not per user  all the main activities and real fun are tied to the first person that started the game the second  third or so players are a kind of dummies without nothing too much to do  expand
2446,no me gustó es horrible  creo que mejor hubiera sido que no vendan cartón a 400 euros 
2447,sorry nintendo  i was really looking forward to play animal crossing on switch  but with the decision to allow just one playable island per device  you areally messed up with me  i will not pay 60  for a copy  until you arethink your policy 
2448,spent hours trying to gather materials  miles  etc  only to find out that my wife s main account is nothe only one able to make progress in the game  our little girl s account cannot even make progress  we cannot even get an axe  this should not be an issue for a game like this  absolutely ridiculous  great game if you have one switch account but terrible with other accounts 
2449,the island being linked to the console is ridiculous   i would be willing to buy a second cartridge for a new island   you are not squeezing another console out of me nintendo   you need to fix this   it does suck because this would be an awesome game if all four of the people in my house that want to play can have their own island 
2450,the first player is nothe only player that can actually progress on the island making playing as player 2 feel like your not part of the story and the island  i understand why making only one island per console but  with this problem making multiple islands a thing seems like a plausible solution  needs fix nintendo  pls fix
2451,if you are a solo player  you will likely enjoy the game  however  the decision to allow only one island per switch  along with the fact that only one player on the island has any power to progress  has hindered my experience to the point that i wouldo not want to continue playing  and had caused me to lose all respect for whoever made this god awful decision

2457,este juego es hermoso  la perfeccion en momentos tan dificil como el que estamos viviendo amo a mis vecinos  y la mecanica de construccion el apartado grafico es perfecto  asi como el apartado tecnico 
2458,an outright fun and amazing game  i feel in love with animal crossing a little late into the game but still found that this one respects the old ones and moves forward with new mechanics  i am having a blast playing this game and would say that most people who enjoyed the older animal crossings would have a blast too only downside is nothat there are no gyroids  hopefully they will add them in 
2459,i am really enjoying this game  i am the only person that plays on my console  so the problems others have complained about do not exist for me  it is been over 15 years since i have played an animal crossing game and this one does not disappoint  as long as you wouldo not have to share your switch with someone else  this is a very fun game and i highly recommend it

2466,first off yes not having your own island is kinda annoying  but it is always been that way every game prior and nobody complained about it  people who give zeros obviously have not played the game  because this is probably the best  game on switch apart from zelda  yes the game is slow but it is nowhere near boring  you always have an objective to do like paying off your mortgage  invitingfirst off yes not having your own island is kinda annoying  but it is always been that way every game prior and nobody complained about it  people who give zeros obviously have not played the game  because this is probably the best  game on switch apart from zelda  yes the game is slow but it is nowhere near boring  you always have an objective to do like paying off your mortgage  inviting new neighbors  etc  this game is mean t to be play like when walk through a park or go on a hike  it is not explosive excitement but it is really relaxing and satisfying  upgrading your house and finishing a section in the museum is incredibly rewarding  in fact have one island per switch is nothe best part  i have 3 other people on the same island and it is nowhere near crowded  having 3 of my siblings makes it feel more like home  being able to trade and help the rest of my family makes the game even more personal  it even got my mom interested interested in video games and overall has helped my family grow closer  in the end  unless you hate your family or roommates having one island will not affect you and maybe it will help you to appreciate others more  expand

2468,three points1  just thinking about the game makes me feel dread  playing it made me feel even more stressed out and anxious  it is an empty world with a cast of empty characters that make you feel even more lonely and stressed out and empty why would you want to spend your time in a soulless world where npc s do not care about you  they can add yearly updates all they want but itthree points1  just thinking about the game makes me feel dread  playing it made me feel even more stressed out and anxious  it is an empty world with a cast of empty characters that make you feel even more lonely and stressed out and empty why would you want to spend your time in a soulless world where npc s do not care about you  they can add yearly updates all they want but it will not make up for the fact that it is a dreadful game  if it is made out of greed and to maximise profit  it ishows because it is sort of try to please everybody world  with no soul  just polished graphics npc s are cute but  as other people already noticed  they have no soul or personality  they are just there with same old bilge they spew every day i wouldo not care how much corrupt media outlets say how it is a wholesome game but there is absolutely nothing wholesome spending your time in a soulless world  where all you wouldo is grind  and spend time with villagers who do not care about you that s sinister  not wholesome 2  speaking of sinister  nintendo did a bang up job marketing this as a family friendly game  when all it does is increase domestic strife  arguments  and stirs up families fighting 3  media outlets who gave this 9 10 are obviously corrupt and have never heard of journalistic integrity you will just feel bad reading or watching people rate this whaoh 10 10 when deep down you know we are going through major crisis of journalistic integrity  there is none  and social media influenced outright lies we aread reviews to make an informed choice  not to spend 300 bucks per console and 60 bucks for game it makes me sick how dishonest these people are pocket camp was free and micro transactions were an option and as far as i cannotell  it did pretty much the same thing  and more  than this hollow product  but this is 300   per console   60 for a game  and fighting with your brothers and sisters   feeling used by a greedy company i think a lot of people are afraid to be honest about how they feel about this because of hive mind mentality that s been going around  but your soul and your relationships are worth much more than this game no game is worth your mental health and friendships breaking up and family arguments  no game  expand
2469,about as much content as a mini clip browser game from 2007  massively lacking in stuff to do  also 1 island per console is infuriating
2470,i wish i had done my homework ahead of time before purchasing  not being able to do separate islands for separate accounts is ridiculous  i have two kids that want to play and they cannot share an island where only one is allowed to make decisions  this was not well thought out for families  i would not have purchased this game at all had i known 
2471,one island  one star  game was enjoyable until someone else in the house wanted to play 
2472,my brother bought this game for me as a gift but he was the first to launch it  before we knew that the game was one island per console which was kind of a bummer but we were fine with it being shared until i played by my self and realized i could not do anything on the island without him  this was very disappointing because now i have no control over a game i was looking forward tomy brother bought this game for me as a gift but he was the first to launch it  before we knew that the game was one island per console which was kind of a bummer but we were fine with it being shared until i played by my self and realized i could not do anything on the island without him  this was very disappointing because now i have no control over a game i was looking forward to playing during shelter in place  expand
2473,it only allows for only 1 island per switch  wich makes player 2s gameplay experience limited  every game has savestates  this is a joke  this was my last nintendo game
2474,bought the special edition switch and the 60  game to share with my brother  only to find out that we cannot create different islands and that the second player can barely do anything  disappointing to say the least  i really cannot believe that nintendo would do something like this  im 100  sure that a lot of families are experiencing the same thing  something so easy to fix as just givingbought the special edition switch and the 60  game to share with my brother  only to find out that we cannot create different islands and that the second player can barely do anything  disappointing to say the least  i really cannot believe that nintendo would do something like this  im 100  sure that a lot of families are experiencing the same thing  something so easy to fix as just giving the option to have different island per user  seriously disappointed with you nintendo do not buy this if you share the switch with someone and this person wants to play the game  expand
2475,multiplayer restrictions kills the game for me  one island  what a joke  this should be a game for family and everyone should have a chance to play  this is one big no from me 
2476,boring  gf wanted me to play it with her but progression is hampered by the limited island 
2477,seriously  one island per nintendo switch  hello  this is a family oriented gaming console  there is definitely more than one person playing this machine  use your brain nintendo  i am disputing the charges with my credit card company to get my money back  this is nothe most idiotic design system i have seen today 
2478,it is not a multiplayer game  it is a single player game where others can visit and support your island  that s it  no method to change residents or share residency  tech support had zero solutions  my wife and i allowed our son to play the game first and it is now unplayable for us  i would get a refund if i could  we bought it as a multiplayer game and shared family experience 
2479,the game is fun  the gameplay is addicting  this low score is based on the fact that if you try to play with multiple profiles  you will only have one island  this means that one person might start the island and have it be theirs and someone else would just be a resident  unable to play the game the way it was meant to be  resources are limited  leading to whoever plays first every daythe game is fun  the gameplay is addicting  this low score is based on the fact that if you try to play with multiple profiles  you will only have one island  this means that one person might start the island and have it be theirs and someone else would just be a resident  unable to play the game the way it was meant to be  resources are limited  leading to whoever plays first every day getting everything and the second being left with nothing  even buying a separate game cartridge will not solve the problem  it is a cheap way to sell switches  and proves nintendo is losing its dedication to customers and families  1 star  expand
2480,i like having to play on one island  but not being able to have the second player make big choices or get the cool recipes that player 1 does is infuriating 
2481,quality game if you have one user in your household who would like to play this game  fairly pointless game for any other users in your household 
2482,the fact you can only have 1 island per console sucks  my husband i purchased  and we are first time players of animal crossing  had we known we could not each have our island  accomplish our own objectives  name them  and all etc  we would have never purchased 
2483,the first person to play is nothe resident representative and is nothe only player that really matters  because my wife and i let my 4 year old son play first because he was so excited now we are at his whim or have to reset the game  ridiculous and shameful of nintendo to think this is acceptable  give us the ability to change the representative  will be telling my friends to not buy thisthe first person to play is nothe resident representative and is nothe only player that really matters  because my wife and i let my 4 year old son play first because he was so excited now we are at his whim or have to reset the game  ridiculous and shameful of nintendo to think this is acceptable  give us the ability to change the representative  will be telling my friends to not buy this game until nintendo fixes their game  expand

2486,i wanted to play with my daughter and go to visit islands of each other but nintendo is notoo greedy  shame nintendo 
2487,this game is great  if you have your own switch that is  me and my brother bought a copy of the game excited to start our own islands  but little did we know after him starting the island we had to share it  since he s the mayor he s always one step ahead of me in everything and has more privileges than i wouldo  alot of people tell me it is tradition in the franchise but i think it is timethis game is great  if you have your own switch that is  me and my brother bought a copy of the game excited to start our own islands  but little did we know after him starting the island we had to share it  since he s the mayor he s always one step ahead of me in everything and has more privileges than i wouldo  alot of people tell me it is tradition in the franchise but i think it is time for a change  i can afford a second copy but i would still have to share the island and quite frankly that s an ea move  as a resident i give it a 3 but if i had my own island i would give it a 10  wake up nintendo  wake up and smell the ashes  expand
2488,the best animal crossing game ever made  but there are some things that should get an update  there are certain objects that should be mass crafted  not just one by one  every tool is notoo easy to break  specially the upgraded ones  also i feel like the island lacks more buildings 
2489,2nd accounts  the one that is not creator of the island  can not advance at the same pace as the principal  they do not let 2nd accounts do practically anything interesting  nor be part of the growth of the island  so basically you are stuck until the principal advance
2490,the game is absolutely stunning  the whole time i was sucked in  somehow i can always find things to do  it has so much freedom  and everything about it is great well  maybe the multiplayer thing and one switch share one island thing was kinda going   i heard  but i was the only one playing  so my review does not include that 
2491,took the essential animal crossing core  and decorated and perfected it with modern mechanics which are additional but meaningful 
2492,really great relaxing game  you need to be patient if you want to get it  everything happens in real time so it is kind of slow but it is still a great game
2493,i have never played an animal crossing before and i cannot stop playing it now  amazing  there are lots of things to do  the characters are all charming  you can visit other islands  customize everything it is a infinit game  people who are giving 0 problably never played the game  and a 0   come on guys  not everybody will like it but a 0 
2494,it is an amazing game  and it is so sad that so many people have spammed negative reviews over one feature that s missing  yes  it is a downside  but that does not mean it is instantly a 0 10  it is still a lot of fun  and there is infinite fun to be had  as you would expect with an animal crossing game 
2495,this game is an amazing addition to the series  it makes me sad to see such a low user rating  as far as i know  animal crossing has always had a main player and secondary players  which did not have the same perks as the main player  i wouldo not understand why so many people are surprised by this

2497,el mejor animal crossing de todos los tiempos  la mayoría que se queja de que solo hay una isla por consola  se ve a legua que no ha jugando nunca en su vida a animal crossing  a arder piperos y respecto a mi opinión  el mejor juego de animal crossing  el unico fallo que le veo  es que no tiene muchas interacciones con los objetos  si pudiera interactuar como los sims  sería increible
2498,magnífico juego que te distrae de todos los problemas del mundo y da una experiencia única  merece mucho la pena
2499,it is purely amazing i wouldo not know what beech flooded the user reviews but this is nothe best game in the series by far
2500,the limit of secondary account  really two players doest enjoy a full gane is stupid  
2501,this game is absolutely revolting  i cannot even believe the audacity of nintendo for creating a  multiplayer game  that only really allows one player to play  i bought this game to play with my family  only to find out that only one player gets to make any real decisions  and if this was advertised it would be one thing  but since you can only really find out while playing this gamethis game is absolutely revolting  i cannot even believe the audacity of nintendo for creating a  multiplayer game  that only really allows one player to play  i bought this game to play with my family  only to find out that only one player gets to make any real decisions  and if this was advertised it would be one thing  but since you can only really find out while playing this game ripped me and my family off  this should be patched immediately or at least advertised  do not buy if you want to play it multiplayer or with your family  expand
2502,nintendo almost made the perfect cozy game  but the extreme limitations put on the second player  and requirement to purchase an entire second console if you want to have two players play on equal footing makes the game unplayable if you wouldo not have a switch for every person in your home who wants to play 
2503,honestly  who thought it was a good idea to make one island per switch  who sat there and said yea that s a great idea people will love that  its not even like they tried to even make it iso the other profiles on the switch can play  you can do literally close to nothing and are stuck living like a literal bum in a tent on whoever s island the main profile belongs to  truly a garbage way tohonestly  who thought it was a good idea to make one island per switch  who sat there and said yea that s a great idea people will love that  its not even like they tried to even make it iso the other profiles on the switch can play  you can do literally close to nothing and are stuck living like a literal bum in a tent on whoever s island the main profile belongs to  truly a garbage way to make a game nintendo  there goes another one of your sales  expand
2504,this game is absolute garbage   did nobody think that multiple people in a household might share a home console  absolute game breaking poor design  worthless 
2505,i wouldo not care about single island per console restriction  but this is simply not a game  all things you can do  walk  pick up stuff  sell stuff  create more stuff to sell  the popularity of this grinding nightmare only can be explained by the fact that the vast majority of people are not very smart 
2506,just a game for cry baby  only for kids under 6 years old i cant undestand buying this baby gane
2507,like the game s single player play through  but the decision to limit it to one island per console  was the the dumbest thing i have seen   i have 4 kids who want to play it  but no one but the one who played first is actually in charge of anything  everyone else is second class stuck on their island   and with the island being as small as it is  even if they were not second class  it makeslike the game s single player play through  but the decision to limit it to one island per console  was the the dumbest thing i have seen   i have 4 kids who want to play it  but no one but the one who played first is actually in charge of anything  everyone else is second class stuck on their island   and with the island being as small as it is  even if they were not second class  it makes everything cramped and horrible   bad job  needs an update to change to one island per account  expand
2508,only the first player created in the game can actually contribute to the development of the island and do the important stuff  the other players on the island cannot contribute and can only really gather resources  this limits every other player than the 1st one and really blows  i hope nintendo fixes this 
2509,read every other comment  we have been scammed  only one real player for each console  the other are restricted assistants  it is so sad  because it would be a 9 10 game if it were not for that 
2510,locking the save data to once switch  limiting a household to one island so only one person can have a full experience  i see broken homes as siblings and souses alike fight over island layouts  this is such a clear money grab shame on you  nintendo

2524,co op multiplayer is a huge disappointment  pretty much a deal breaker for me and my wife  hopefully nintendo will fix this  but being essentially a bot for another player is horrible and seems like a very lazy design choice 
2525,thought i would have a great time getting into a series i have been recommended by friends for years  i cannot even enjoy my own single player experience because i happened to be the second person in my house to make a character  waste of money 
2526,the one island per console is a really huge issue  nintendo just wants you to buy more consoles and copies  if they added the option to share an island  this could be one of the greats on the switch  but sadly greed is a thing 
2527,both my wife and i wanted to play this game on our switch  apparently that isn t possible  for shame 
2528,the game would be a whole lot better if they had added the dream suite as well as club tortimer back to the game  at the moment even with quite a bit of progression it iseems like they released an unfinished game with even less content than they had in new leaf it is still a beautiful game  do not get me wrong  but within a month even without time travelling i have nearly completed the museumthe game would be a whole lot better if they had added the dream suite as well as club tortimer back to the game  at the moment even with quite a bit of progression it iseems like they released an unfinished game with even less content than they had in new leaf it is still a beautiful game  do not get me wrong  but within a month even without time travelling i have nearly completed the museum and have already gotten close to receiving golden tool diy recipes if nintendo added the dream suite and club tortimer back with its public island as well as a lot of the other features they added in the previous instalment then i would be rating this way higher but so far it just seems like the game is a carbon copy of the previous games before new leaf that s even been dumbed down by just giving a crafting option to make it iseem as if the game is giving you  more things to do   when in reality you are really just repeating the same stuff over and over and over again tediously  for being a flagship ip of nintendo  this game really let me down with the expectations i had for it and i would not be surprised if this would prevent me from buying the next one or further nintendo consoles because of this as this game was the reason i purchased the switch  expand

2536,hate to be part of review bombing but i think it is the only way to have attention brought to this it is one thing to limit everyone to one island the island is large enough that if people do not want to live near each other they can stay apart   but the current system in which the island s progress is completely tied to the progress of whoever the first player on the console is ishate to be part of review bombing but i think it is the only way to have attention brought to this it is one thing to limit everyone to one island the island is large enough that if people do not want to live near each other they can stay apart   but the current system in which the island s progress is completely tied to the progress of whoever the first player on the console is is absolutely ridiculous   there is no need for it in my eyes  i cannot see any reason why it ishould have to be this way  i wouldo not want to be cynical of nintendo  but it honestly feels like a move to sell more systems simply because i cannot fathom any other reason that would be necessary personally speaking as a player 2 on the island  it feels like i have no point in playing   i wouldo not get assignments from tom nook  which means i wouldo not get any recipes like my p1 does  i also do not get to invite citizens to the island  or plan infrastructure  or make any decisions   basically i am playing home decorator 2020  because i cannot contribute anything to the island aside from paying money towards bridges stairs and throwing some furniture outside hopefully the devs catch wind of the review bombing and seek to patch this out sooner rather than later   again  being on one island is fine  but having no options to contribute as player 2 is ridiculous   its as simple as giving p2  the options to change infrastructure and invite settlers  and if you are worried about doubling up missions  just have tom nook announce that someone else is working on an assignment for him already  and then have him lay out what the assignment is and give the recipes needed for the other players to help  expand

2546,you guys know that the one island per console thing does not ruin the whole game right  and that one thing doesnt make the whole game awful right 
2547,the very fact that nintendo in their infinite wisdom have only allowed one island per console means this game gets an absolute zero  total   move on their part  based on greed and nothing more

2563,i wouldo love this game  very much  but there are a lot of clunky things that i am disappointed to see  considering almost all of the reviews on here are about the inability to create multiple islands on one console  i will not cover that  and it was not an issue for me  as i am the only person who uses my switch  however  i have a lot of other disappointments  i will not go over the things i lovei wouldo love this game  very much  but there are a lot of clunky things that i am disappointed to see  considering almost all of the reviews on here are about the inability to create multiple islands on one console  i will not cover that  and it was not an issue for me  as i am the only person who uses my switch  however  i have a lot of other disappointments  i will not go over the things i love because the critics covered it all everything they said is definitely true  this is by far the best animal crossing yet  despite the huge flaws  i am very disappointed to see that there is no way to access your storage outside of your home  the storage is much better than before  do not get me wrong you can store much more  and the game auto sorts your stuff for you  character customization and clothing customization is far better than ever  but when you add crafting  several things need to be changed  even in previous games  you could access your storage through either the post office or train station  considering you can place items which used to link to your storage  dressers  chests  etc  out in your island now  why cannot you use those to access storage  i know this would not be  realistic  but animal crossing isn t exactly about realism  the multiplayer is clunky as hell  too  connection has been pretty bad every time i play  and the longass animation whenever people join or leave is awful  if you want to play with more than one friend at once  you are out of luck  not to mention that if someone tries to leave  and others do not  close their windows   aka  menus or conversations  a ten second timer will tick down  if it hits 0  the person trying to leave will go home with an error code and lose everything they did while on the island  as well as everyone else losing what they got while interacting with the player  this is absolutely horrendous and makes no sense to me  players can essentially sabotage others if they want to using this  also  the restrictions on what you can do while others are over is annoying  why cannot i rearrange furniture when someone s over  why cannot i order catalog items  it is infuriating  particularly the inability to move things around your island or home  the crafting system and shops also sorely need updates  why cannot i craft more than one thing at once  why do some of my diy recipes require that i know other diy recipes  why cannot i use a slider to buy however many flower seeds i want  like when buying turnips from daisy mae  why cannot i buy more than one shirt or pants at the able sisters  it never feels good to sit there and watch the crafting animation 30 times in a row because you are just trying to make fish bait to catch a rare fish  this should be much  much easier to do  there are some little improvements i love the drop off box for selling items is great  and i like the way flowers are handled  as well as the terraforming  but why are custom paths still able to be destroyed with the b button  the same button for picking up items  mind you  and why can other people destroy them  if you are going to add paths to the game  and the ability to literally pave custom paths using this path tool  why do not they act like paths  the game is certainly not worth a 0 10  it is fantastic  but all of these small issues are a huge disappointment  expand
2564,i feel like this game is either getting hailed as one of the greatest or hated on for its flawed local multiplayer aspect  as i am the only one playing on my switch  that does not bother me and nothing is stopping me from joining the ones praising this game greatly however  i feel like the game is just  good  i get that it is not designed to take hours of your time daily  but i felt oni feel like this game is either getting hailed as one of the greatest or hated on for its flawed local multiplayer aspect  as i am the only one playing on my switch  that does not bother me and nothing is stopping me from joining the ones praising this game greatly however  i feel like the game is just  good  i get that it is not designed to take hours of your time daily  but i felt on the first day that it was just extremely empty and it was quite off putting  then i began questioning my decision to buy the game  fortunately  there is more to do in the next days some criticism comes from the click a fest that occurs during some conversations  some people defend it by saying it is a part of the game and it helps the immersion  well  i would agree if the dialogue would get switched up and i would not need to repeat four choices after getting an error or missclicking the last one  unfortunately  there is no variance and no new lines  everyone just keeps repeating their own spiel  doing things like museum donations or flying to another islands gets super tedious and annoying rather fast  the constant interruptions in multiplayer do not add to the charm either  read that as  the multiplayer in this game is completely atrocious and utterly useless content wise the game is good and i feel there is still more for me to uncover  as i like this kind of games in general  i look forward to it   but i have to acknowledge it is definitely not for everyone  expand

2568,game gets boring very quickly  same as every other game  you complete chores to earn money and increase the size of your house  the crafting system is interesting in the beginning  but gets stale very quickly and cannot be used for anything actually important  like infrastructure additionally  the island from the last game which was a good place to make some quick money  was removed andgame gets boring very quickly  same as every other game  you complete chores to earn money and increase the size of your house  the crafting system is interesting in the beginning  but gets stale very quickly and cannot be used for anything actually important  like infrastructure additionally  the island from the last game which was a good place to make some quick money  was removed and replaced with randomly generated islands that are usually devoid of anything interesting  ok if you are stuck in the apocalyptic covid 19 quarantine nightmare  but there are more fun ways to spend your time  also  i cannot believe there isn t a voice chat on the switch  it is so annoying to have to type things to your friends with a  20 character limit  expand

2574,this game is awful  for so  many  reasons  multiplayer is a nightmare   no matter if you are playing locally or online  online   oh god   that s a mess  over and over again  people can leave your island by disconnecting or just quitting   which results in you losing anything that you ve done or received  that 100k or cool recipe you just got  poof  it is gone  congrats  and the onethis game is awful  for so  many  reasons  multiplayer is a nightmare   no matter if you are playing locally or online  online   oh god   that s a mess  over and over again  people can leave your island by disconnecting or just quitting   which results in you losing anything that you ve done or received  that 100k or cool recipe you just got  poof  it is gone  congrats  and the one island per switch choice is moronic  if you are a parent thinking you can get this and enjoy playing with your kids but having your own island   you are sol but if you want  i can still come visit your islan  hold on a second  the game needs to pause every time someone leaves or enters your island  so if you just got some killer turnip prices or a meteor shower and want to make some money from people visiting um  good luck with that  it is fantastic gameplay  lemme tell you however  what makes this game so bad goes far  far beyond that  you get a dialog popup for  every  single  thing  that  you  do  caught that same fish for the 100th time  let me give you a dialog box  want to visit another island  here is 10 dialog boxes for you  want to craft an item  here is 5 dialog boxes for each item you want to craft  did you close that dialog box  here is another one for closing it  so much time is spent on stupid aspects of the game that are simply   dumb   design decisions by the way  you will be crafting each item individually as there is no bulk crafting  fishing is annoying as the timing of when fish change directions is almost exactly the same as the time it takes for each cast  nmt islands get boring incredibly fast  this game repeatedly feels like a free to play game because at multiple points  you cannot progress until a day passes i have played life sim games like this  at this point  i am wholly recommending you play stardew over this game  it is cheaper too  and the dev will straight up respond to your suggestions or bug reports on twitter  the sad thing is all of these issues are just dumb design choices that could be fixed easily with a patch  the qa team should be fired for how bad this game feels at times  expand

2578,i thought i had not played this game  but it turns out i have been the 9th player the whole time missing out on little more than player 2 8  in fact i would say i am much more satisfied at my rating 
2579,okay  first 1 save files is notrash  i was going to try to share the joy of animal crossing with a loved one  but the way the game is nothat person would need their own switch or to exclusively use mine  i find this noterrible nintendo allow us to have multiple save files 
2580,it is a one player game  for the most part  so deal with it  for what it is  it is an amazing game  you wouldo not need to gripe about the multiplayer  while it is a bad feature  the game is still incredibly beautiful and fun to play 
2581,the limitation of one island per switch  not per cartridge  per switch  is no good  it is obvious nintendo is just trying to sell more  nintendo bad attitude

2586,i wouldo not normally post reviews  much less ones that are so negative  but the fact that you can only have one island in this game is nototal bs  i got this game so my household could enjoy it iseparately  and be able to have their own saved islands on their profile  but apparently in order to do that they would all need their own switch as well  so this was a complete waste of 60  to me 
2587,this game is broken  it looks really fun  however i refuse to buy it based on the fact that it limits the experience to one user  secondary users are faced with a minimal version of the game  horrible proprietary business move nintendo  i will not be buying this game until this is fixed

2602,i am long time player of animal crossing  i have played every version of the game  and this is nothe worst yet  the game mechanics themselves and the new features are wonderful  but nintendo did a terrible job when it comes to multiplayer  the way it was setup only one island is available per switch system  who decided that was a good idea  why not one island per account  ori am long time player of animal crossing  i have played every version of the game  and this is nothe worst yet  the game mechanics themselves and the new features are wonderful  but nintendo did a terrible job when it comes to multiplayer  the way it was setup only one island is available per switch system  who decided that was a good idea  why not one island per account  or something that makes sense for a console  they designed the game like it was for the ds  it made sense on the ds because normally that isn t a shared console  but the switch is meant to be shared  so why can only one person make important decisions  a great game series with a horrible idea by nintendo  i am very disappointed  it needs to be updated so everyone account has their own island  i would gladly start over instead of being under the dictatorship nintendo gives to the first account that plays the game  fix this  it is the only complaint people have  it ishould ve been fixed by now  expand
2603,despite a few glaring flaws  animal crossing  new horizons is a good game if you have got it for yourself  as this is not the case for every human being on our planet  the story does not end here the fact  that you cannot have more than one island per console is definetly a deal breaker and rather despicable  doing so was a conscious and calculated decicion by nintendo  considering thatdespite a few glaring flaws  animal crossing  new horizons is a good game if you have got it for yourself  as this is not the case for every human being on our planet  the story does not end here the fact  that you cannot have more than one island per console is definetly a deal breaker and rather despicable  doing so was a conscious and calculated decicion by nintendo  considering that having more islands was possible on previous versions  charging 60   or whatever currency you are using is far from okay and nothing but a shameless cash grab  i wouldo think that nintendo deserves significant hate for their decicion and also think that my score is justified for this reason  a game  that forces family members to be some kind of slaves to whoever happened to start the game  does not deserve any rating above five and considering that there are many other things  visiting friends is difficult  villager dialogue is repetitive  i will not be ashamed of considering this noto be a bad game overall  expand

2606,my brother and i were super excited for this game  until we bought it and found out we would not be able to have our own islands  you may say that we should ve known this before purchasing  but the switch has multiple profiles  therefore leading us to believe we could have multiple save files  just like every other switch game  we now share a character in order for us to both sharemy brother and i were super excited for this game  until we bought it and found out we would not be able to have our own islands  you may say that we should ve known this before purchasing  but the switch has multiple profiles  therefore leading us to believe we could have multiple save files  just like every other switch game  we now share a character in order for us to both share resident representative duties  but we would much rather have our own personal islands  we are very disappointed that nintendo would do such a greedy thing in order to sell more consoles  expand
2607,0 for forcing players to share an island for no other reason than to encourage multiple console purchases  games have had multiple save file slots for virtually all of gaming history  there is no explanation other than greed

2609,overall the game is fun and enjoyable  if you were to play the game for 20 minutes a day and did not care about multiplayer features  local or online  then you could probably enjoy the game  however  the game is bogged down with hundreds of tiny flaws that combine to create an overall frustrating experience  with each new switch game that releases it becomes increasingly more apparent thatoverall the game is fun and enjoyable  if you were to play the game for 20 minutes a day and did not care about multiplayer features  local or online  then you could probably enjoy the game  however  the game is bogged down with hundreds of tiny flaws that combine to create an overall frustrating experience  with each new switch game that releases it becomes increasingly more apparent that nintendo simply does not understand how to design a game or what their players want  nintendo is worse than ea because at least ea games are not  60 seven years after release  nintendo cannot deliver what its players want in a game  they keep releasing titles with the philosophy of we know best  and it does not lead to fun gameplay  expand

2611,unable to visit other people s islands   i get some kind of error it will not let me visit friend s islands and they cannot come to mine    this was marketed as a social experience and i cannot engage with the one feature i bought the game for   nintendo will not allow a refund  buyer beware 
2612,one island  one switch  fine  i guess me and my girlfriend can have a cute co op experience  oh what s that  i cannot progress the game unless my girlfriend continues for me  why 
2613,the game is fun but can be a bit boring if you are not skipping days  cheating  but it is very fun and addictive if you wouldo skip days and complete missions  the bad side is nothat you need to log in every day  like most animal crossing games mostly recommended in the quarantine

2631,one island per switch   inexcusable  wish they gave refunds   this is nothing more than a money grab   do not buy this game

2633,got this for my wife and i  i wouldid not know that only one of us could make any decisions in the game so i guess it is just for her now  would be nice to play together but what s the point when i cannot do anything interesting  thanks nintendo  i remember when you made good co op games 
2634,i was under the assumption we could have multiple islands on one console  had somebody told me you could not we would not have bought it  if they update it to hold multiple islands id gladly change my review  0 10
2635,the fact that they only allow one island per console is idiotic  i am not going go buy a second switch and a second copy just so my wife and i can play on different islands  sharing an island between multiple accounts is horrible for personal gameplay and extremely limiting to anyone who starts playing after the first account starts the island 
2636,once again i was allured to animal crossing more than ever  it was fun  it was great  but soon  slowly but truly its charm disappeared a fair amount i am not a fan of review bombing  but i am surely counting negative aspects that a lot of people are complaining about  if not for them  this review will be easily a 9 or so  but as it is  i believe a 7 is a fair score  without further adoonce again i was allured to animal crossing more than ever  it was fun  it was great  but soon  slowly but truly its charm disappeared a fair amount i am not a fan of review bombing  but i am surely counting negative aspects that a lot of people are complaining about  if not for them  this review will be easily a 9 or so  but as it is  i believe a 7 is a fair score  without further ado my thoughts are as follows starting with the positive things  nh is as ever an incredible time if you are up to the task of giving your heart to it  long gone are those days when you could only customize your house  now the full island has customization  and almost every furniture or item is placeable wherever you want  and it gives a lot of freedom and customization  as it was in new leaf where you could make public structures  like arches or statues  now they re just items like it ishould have from a long time ago  another good addition is its new point system called  nook miles  in which you have to meet certain requirements like achievements and you will be rewarded with miles  this system comes as unique achievements and a daily wheel of minor achievements that can be done over and over  in contrast with past entries where at a certain point you simply turn off the game because you wouldid not have more things to do for that day  these miles can be exchanged for several things like furniture  clothes or unique diy recipes  this new mechanic in form of diy is easily one of the most enjoyable things in nh  they come as gifts from villagers  message bottles  rewards  etc  the fun part is nothat you need certain items to make them  so a lot of your time will be invested in acquiring items to make your recipes  pure joy by far  the best thing that nh has to offer is noterraforming  although it has its limitations  it is easily the most entertaining addition  do you want to make your island like a crater  maybe a fortress  or how about a city  the limit is your determination and creativity  and maybe at times money  but it isurely is nothe thing that a lot of veterans were waiting  think of it as a minecraft ripoff  but with animal crossing makeover as for the negatives  there are a lot of issues that can be resumed into 4 main problems  at least to me  they were not a problem at first but everything went a little downhill once you notice them  first and the most common issue for everyone is nothe one island per switch  when the official trailer launched and stated that this game will be multiplayer with a common island i was really into  i and my partner were daydreaming about the things and possibilities of playing co op  turns out that the local multiplayer is more a gimmick and the second player is basically a background pc  although the biggest issue is nothat the only the 1st resident can advance through the main quest so good luck if your 1st resident is not as active as you  the second issue is its online mode  if you are playing with one friend is just serviceable  but if you are going to play with two or more persons  friends or internet people  you will notice that every single time a person arrives or leaves your island  every player that is in the island have to watch an unskippable  quite long  cutscene  not only that  for some unthinkable reason  you cannot navigate through menus or inventory in that particular moment  otherwise  the cutscene will be delayed  this is a serious problem particularly if you are planning to play this with several friends or if you are into the stalk market  prepare to loose 15 20 min per arrival my third issue is more a quality of life issue  you see  animal crossing have ever being a game about of time  you have to wait a lot in order to have the best of it  but  at this point  selling  buying and navigating through menus is quite a burden  not only that  there are too many nitpicks to list in here  but  certainly it iseems more like the game is keeping you away from having fun  is not like there are not a lot of things to do  so it feels more like cheap padding than anything the last issue and the one that i hate the most and it iseems that no one is notalking about  is its free updates  when the first official trailer launched with its terraforming promises  it also mentioned something that bothered me a lot  the fact its main events will arrive as free updates as if they need to be charged or something  in past entries these seasonal events wherein the main game  so it feels way too worrisome that now they re extra  if this game was a mmo or online specific  i would not mind but  it is more like i paid full price for a game that is not finished  so if you are like me and want to play this game in some years  good luck finding those free updates if you took your time to read this whole thing  i appreciate it a lot  even if you agree or not  i like this game a lot and have played 100 hours to this point but  is important to address its issues

2637,this is  overall  a really great experience  i can say in full confidence that you will like this game  even if you think you will not  in fact  this game probably has the most positive impact on people who do not think they will like it  from the perspective of someone who s played every game in the series since the ds  i can also vouch for this one is easily the best aside from some minorthis is  overall  a really great experience  i can say in full confidence that you will like this game  even if you think you will not  in fact  this game probably has the most positive impact on people who do not think they will like it  from the perspective of someone who s played every game in the series since the ds  i can also vouch for this one is easily the best aside from some minor inconveniences and one really major inconvenience i ll get to in a minute  this game s new ideas shine  there is a lot of quality of life changes  but in typical animal crossing fashion  it is still kinda bad  for example  you wouldo not have to worry about waiting for furniture to show up in the store because you can craft them as many times as you want whenever you want  so long as you have the materials to do so  but you cannot craft the same thing in bulk  so if you have 19 manilla clams  you are gonna have to wait through 19 animations and select the options 19 times  it is not a huge deal  but it is a bummer  it is still not easy to time travel  which i understand makes me automatically the worst person on earth and the bane of some tumblr users  existence  but it really should be made much easier to allow people to play the game the way they want to play it  especially since the solution to not being able to sell things after the stores close is  not good  it is bad  it isucks  you just have to wait until the shop opens to get 80  of the bells you would ve made if you would just waited until the morning to hand it to the shop owners directly  so it completely misses the point  but again  it is really not that big a deal that stuff holds it back from a perfect 10 out of 10  but the good absolutely outweighs the bad here  i have told this noto each of my friends individually  and i ll say it again  buy this game  do it  expand
2638,animal crossing  new horizons is an extremely relaxing game  like the games before it  you are moved into a small town and make it a thriving community  though previous games had multiplayer  new horizons does it extremely well  if you have patience  it is extremely satisfying
2639,as close to perfection a game can get  tiniest grievances aside  eg  lack of bulk crafting  tedious cycling between tools  this is notrue fun for the entire family we are 4 kids and two parents deep into this and everyone loves it unequivocally  the review bombing is definitely unwarranted another stellar aaa title from nintendo 
2640,this is advertised as a multiplayer game but it is not  it is a one player game that a second person can join in and watch  even if you wouldecide to buy 2 switches and 2 games once you start an island with 2 people there is no way to separate the 2 or move your save files

2642,i give it a destroying 0 simply because nintendo deliberately chose to make it only fun for the first player who created the island  now my wife purchased the game and created it without knowing this  a couple of weeks into it  my son has joined the adventure only to find out he cannot make most decisions and is limited by how far my wife has progressed  i started playing to see what iti give it a destroying 0 simply because nintendo deliberately chose to make it only fun for the first player who created the island  now my wife purchased the game and created it without knowing this  a couple of weeks into it  my son has joined the adventure only to find out he cannot make most decisions and is limited by how far my wife has progressed  i started playing to see what it was all about and indeed  it is a utterly terrible decision made by nintendo to require you to buy 1  another switch console and 2  another acnh copy and 3  not allow you in any way to keep your save game online and 4  not allow you to transfer the part that you ve progressed to another switch console with another game copy netting  260  so the game does not deserve anything more than a 0  nintendo should feel the pain and fix this  for any other game i know it is super easy to do all those things on the same console and heck  even the free to play fortnite gives me the possibility to switch between xbox and switch freely  the same goes with my son and we do not even need the online membership to play online  yet here we are with acnh and i would not be bother with the  35 additional yearly membership for a family subscription  if it would allow the full experience and not limit you to the progress of the first player  which becomes frustrating extremely quickly  and not just that  you know what the only option is for the 2nd 3rd 4th player when  in this example my wife  the first player stops liking acnh and therefore stops playing  you might ve guessed it  start completely over with a completely blank island altogether  there is no way to transfer the ownership or keep your own progress in any way  i ll keep repeating this  but this is a terrible decision by nintendo and basically one that says  we only cater to those willing to shell out huge amounts of money on a duplicate console and a duplicate copy of the game  for that nintendo deserves a 0 for acnh  expand

2645,a game geared towards being family friendly does not allow each family member to experience the intended fun of creating their own island  very trashy of nintendo to do something like this  does not matter how cute and fun the game is  the foundation is flawed and ruins everything built on it 
2646,only first player can create an island  it is an actual issue for others  but not for me and should still be fixed  this game has a lot of charm and some fun  but a lot of the charm is stepped on by how overly tedious the game is and how terrible the programmers are on a technical side  want to join an island with a bunch of friends and hold an event  well  welcome to about 10 minutes ofonly first player can create an island  it is an actual issue for others  but not for me and should still be fixed  this game has a lot of charm and some fun  but a lot of the charm is stepped on by how overly tedious the game is and how terrible the programmers are on a technical side  want to join an island with a bunch of friends and hold an event  well  welcome to about 10 minutes of loading screens because every person who comes in needs to essentially reset the island and have a giant loading screen it isn t just when it comes to playing online  it is just about every aspect from finding certain characters and needing to prompt dialogue with them 5x to get to the right spot  let us pretend that programmers cannot make dialogue a continuous thing lol  or trying to fish and the fish moving a little bit out of your way and having to cast the line with little to no aim  you constantly miss shovel spots  hit ispots  balloons  and so many things because the way the game is designed is just  very incredibly poor the developers basically see traditional gaming and try to piss on it  which is fine and dandy  but what s left is a technically bad game with overly tedious moments that take control of the game 95  of the play  it iseems like nintendo hired 3rd year programming students who have some help from veterans on how to get stuff done  but overall you cannotell the programmers in this game are just daft and at the end of their wits  which is why it also does not shock me that it is one island per switch  it is literally them being incapable of programming that logic into the game  expand
2647,the choice to make the island binded to the switch instead of the profile is unaccettable  the players 2  are simply guest  they cannot do any decision on the island  cannot build any new building and cannot make decisions on new guests  it is a dull and boring gameplay that strike every family member that does not create the island  really short sighted  will change my vote if they will fix the choice to make the island binded to the switch instead of the profile is unaccettable  the players 2  are simply guest  they cannot do any decision on the island  cannot build any new building and cannot make decisions on new guests  it is a dull and boring gameplay that strike every family member that does not create the island  really short sighted  will change my vote if they will fix  sign the petition  https www change org p nintendo animal crossing new horizons should not restrict to one island per console  expand
2648,i am beyond frustrated with this game  this is nothe first animal crossing i ever play  i know the new leaf players had it worst but this stressed me out i bought this game because everyone was raving about how awesome and relaxing it is  knowing we were going to be on lockdown i thought this was the perfect game for this  i have clocked many hours on stardew valley so i thought this was righti am beyond frustrated with this game  this is nothe first animal crossing i ever play  i know the new leaf players had it worst but this stressed me out i bought this game because everyone was raving about how awesome and relaxing it is  knowing we were going to be on lockdown i thought this was the perfect game for this  i have clocked many hours on stardew valley so i thought this was right up my alley  but it is not the first days were very entertaining  everything is new and you feel progress in the course of the initial settlement of your very own island where you are the representative  but slowly but surely you become what you are escaping from in reality  just an employee  in this case  an employee of tom nook you want a bridge  pay upyou want a ramp  pay upyou want to relocate a building  pay upmore storage  pay upanother room  pay uptravel to random islands  pay up furniture  pay upclothing  pay upeven the things you wouldo daily consist on a exchange of currency  if you want to relocate a tree  you have to consume fruit to be able to relocate it  your tools break so you have to constantly get materials to craft them again and every time you move 1 ramp  one bridge or one building it takes 1 whole real life day  yeah  it will not be finished until 5 am the next day  1 ramp bridge per day  if you want to destroy and build another bridge  you cannot relocate them  you have to pay again  you have to wait til the day after tomorrow  on the positive side the game looks gorgeous  there is an immense amount of items  furniture  clothing  wallpapers  floors etc the art of the game is impecable but the problem is nothat this is a game of collecting items and decorating  it may not be for everyone  there is not much to do story wise after you finish paying the 5 rooms you can expand on your home and achieve a 3 rating star on your island   so you are left with decorating and collecting items  and that s it  a beautiful shell of a game with no much gameplay but shake trees and mine ores also  you cannot build more than 8 ramps in your island  you cannot build ramps next to another  you cannot build a ramp that leads straight to your museum because they are made of 2 blocks and the museum is 5 blocks wide  the lack of symmetry on some parts makes me irrationally mad  the cherry on top is nothat you can only have 1 island per switch  the dialog is very unintuitive and the online functionality is ok but a pain if you have more than 2 3 visitors with unnecessary repetitive loading animations  expand
2649,why is no one talking about how they only put it for nintendo switch i was so excited for the game to come but now i am so sad because i cannot buy a nintendo switch  besides ac has always been for nintendo 3ds they could put it for both nintendo s 
2650,the game looks fun to play and i bought it for my gf  now i want to join as well but learning that i cannot have my own island without getting a new switch is absolutely unacceptable  what an absolutely greed fueled money grab  both parties involved should be ashamed of themselves
2651,1  as in the number of islands you can have per console  such a shame this is a thing 
2652,the game only allows one island per switch console  this means i cannot truly play the game  as my wife made an account first  now i am just a side character  and whats more we have to split all the resources on the island  this was a terrible cash grab  we are not made of money and cannot just afford to buy two switches for no reason  nintendo is greedy  i wouldo not think i ll be buying anythe game only allows one island per switch console  this means i cannot truly play the game  as my wife made an account first  now i am just a side character  and whats more we have to split all the resources on the island  this was a terrible cash grab  we are not made of money and cannot just afford to buy two switches for no reason  nintendo is greedy  i wouldo not think i ll be buying any nintendo products anytime soon  seeing as they will likely have ridiculous cash grabs built into them as well  expand
2653,this is a real disappointment for me  the game just isn t meant to be played by more than one person at a time  the limitation of  one island per console  makes it a lackluster experience for anyone who isn t the founder of the island  i am finding that  if i let my wife play first  when i get into my account there is nothing left for me to do  it is pretty slimy to make people spend  250 500this is a real disappointment for me  the game just isn t meant to be played by more than one person at a time  the limitation of  one island per console  makes it a lackluster experience for anyone who isn t the founder of the island  i am finding that  if i let my wife play first  when i get into my account there is nothing left for me to do  it is pretty slimy to make people spend  250 500 extra on top of the  60 price of the game to make their own island  nintendo is losing my respect here  always knew sony and microsoft did not care about the user experience  just how much money they make  it is an even playing field now  i guess  expand
2654,can only have one island per switch  bad multiplayer design on a switch with multiple users 
2655,nintendo  fix this  this one island deal is an outrage  can anyone tell me of another game that has ever done this  sorry but i am not buying a second switch so that my wife can play this game for like two months and then wait for the next bandwagon game to catch on 
2656,it is a very simple game with simple mechanism but still  you can be creative and flexible in creating basically everything according to your taste  the only complain i had is nothat the nook s cranny should not have closing time  10pm  bc realistically speaking  not everyone has the time to play the game let us say  at daytime 
2657,the multiplayer of ac nh and the events  until eastern  are trash  but the game is very nice and with a lot of love for detai  its the perfect game for come down and relax 
2658,the dialogue can be a bit repetitive but overall this is a great game to play  i am the only player on my switch so not being able to have multiple islands is not a problem for me  visiting other island via internet is very seamless in my experience  definitely a good upgrade from new leaf and previous versions out there

2660,people is full of sh t on this review  buy your own game and do not think about you can pay 1 get 2  game is awsome btw
2661,this game does not allow multiple save files  the switch is not a handheld device  that is what the ds line is for  it is a console  spending 300  on a ds is absurd  so to say i need a second switch to have my own file is also absurd  big swing and a miss  and easily fixed  nintendo 
2662,you stole my money  you wouldid not advise that this game was only for 1 player  nintendo switch is a family console  so it is so annoying that there is no way to play more than 1 person  the other players are just spectators that cant evolve while the main player is nothe only one that can make progress in the game  if this is a way to make people buying more switches  you are   robbers
2663,biggest f  up of 2020  nintendo the fact that only one island can exist per console  not per account  is a deal breaker  our switch is shared between my sister and i  and this single element ruined the whole game  i wouldo not understand how the producers  even thought this would be a good idea thanks for ruining what could have been game of the year 
2664,ok so i actually created my mc account just to review this game  i read it had been review bombed on here iso bought it anyway despite all the bad reviews  after owning for a week i can actually believe there would be that many negative reviews it is really disappointing  me and my daughter hammered stardew valley for hours days on end she has been so excited for this noto replace it  the gfxok so i actually created my mc account just to review this game  i read it had been review bombed on here iso bought it anyway despite all the bad reviews  after owning for a week i can actually believe there would be that many negative reviews it is really disappointing  me and my daughter hammered stardew valley for hours days on end she has been so excited for this noto replace it  the gfx are better and as a single player game she says its ok  but the multi player game they really dropped the ball so you can only have one island per console  at first i wouldid not think this was too much an issue we could both play on that island although i would have liked to have a separate island under my user account i can progress and send my character to hers it is not possible  one progressing player per console  basically if you are the person playing with the island owner everything you wouldo is pointless  items you pick up go straight in the island recycle bin  so you can switch leader but this is just covering up the fact this is equally pointless as what s the point nothing you wouldo matters you may be able to access your nook phone as leader but then the other person s stuff just goes straight in the recycle bin instead  it is sad as my daughter is 8 she loves us playing games together she wants me to play this but it is just mind numbingly boring for the second player  the second player can pick items up they go straight in the town recycling bin so unless you want to run all way back there the leader may as well pick everything up as you are never more than a few steps away from each other as you as sharing the same screen  i basically spent hours just following her around like a dog on a lead  and every time i pick my damn bone up it vanishes into the village bin and only my owner can pick it out  following her doing absolutely nothing you cannot even explore as you get teleported right next to them when you areach the edge of the screen  i cannotell she s disappointed when i say you just play on your own but jesus there is only so many hours you can spend pointlessly walking around after someone with no purpose what so ever and if you wouldo get involved and pick some items up you have to walk all way back the town centre to pick them up and even then only the leader can access them so i pick them up we walk all way to town square then she picks them out she even said i amay as well pick them up in first place because then we do not have to run back and forth  i think to call this a multiplayer game at all is a disgrace  i am not a review bomber just a very disappointed dad  we bought it for multiplay and we are playing stardew valley again a week later that cost us  10 years ago  i tried to keep the review serious but multiplayer is a joke so we had 5min fun her making me out silly outfits on  apart from that i honestly have had more fun playing with the old paperclip microsoft office assistant  everything switch seems to be a cash cow theese days  nintendo asking  59 for mario kart 8 deluxe still which is just a rehash of mario kart 8 that came out 7 or so years ago on their last gen console and super mario bros u deluxe  some crook in nintendo saying yes let us take our old game bang deluxe on the end and re release it istill for top money on the new console  i will not be buying another nintendo game system  it is only getting 2 stars as a single player game it is alright but only one player can play single player unless you buy another switch and another game as all the other user accounts have to use the same island only the island owner can progress on  just glad my other child is 2 and does not understand as i would be livid at the thought of having to buy another switch and game so he could play single player as well what a damn disgrace  i am utterly disgusted with this money grabbing joke of a game  bottom line want a fun game to play with your kids get stardew valley or minecraft might be old but just as good and the price is spot on value for what you get  this game replaces nothing  better yet get a windows 95 pc and have a conversation with the office assistant  pathetic  pathetic  expand
2665,this game is awful  i purchased it for my 4 year old daughter thinking she could have a game that would allow her to create spaces  it looked pretty  cute  and easy to navigate  it isn t  it requires the user to be able to read  which is not the average 4 year old  and it is wordy  everything a character says is some lengthy explanation of what to do next  there is no action  it is boring this game is awful  i purchased it for my 4 year old daughter thinking she could have a game that would allow her to create spaces  it looked pretty  cute  and easy to navigate  it isn t  it requires the user to be able to read  which is not the average 4 year old  and it is wordy  everything a character says is some lengthy explanation of what to do next  there is no action  it is boring  complete waste of  64  anything i purchase for the switch going forward will be from the mario genre  do not waste your money on animal crossing  expand
2666,this game is not a multiplayer game  only the first player will be able to fully enjoy the game  since they will be the mayor  the other who start playing later will not be able to decide how the island will develop  since they will be forced to live on the same island 1 island per profile nintendo  this is a blatant attempt to force consumers to buy more systems  stop being so greedy 
2667,not only can i not have my own island  i cannot progress in the game until my wife hits certain milestones in the game  i spent 8 hours playing the game trying to figure out why i wouldid not have an axe yet and it was because she did not show a npc two bugs  straight trash designed to sell consoles  hard pass 
2668,wanted to play this game with my partner  turns out you cannot  wish i knew before purchasing the game  fix your game nintendo 
2669,the policy of one island per switch console is an inexcusable deal breaker for any family with more than one family member  or for that matter for any person wanting to re play the game for a different experience at a later time without deleting old saves  bad excuses of anti cheating or whatever are just red herrings  since such measures can be implemented in other ways without breakingthe policy of one island per switch console is an inexcusable deal breaker for any family with more than one family member  or for that matter for any person wanting to re play the game for a different experience at a later time without deleting old saves  bad excuses of anti cheating or whatever are just red herrings  since such measures can be implemented in other ways without breaking the game  it is obvious this is just a cheap way of nintendo forcing the players to buy more consoles  expand

2672,i wouldo not understand why this game is so highly praised  after about a month of owning it i can say its  just okay when you start the game  you are drawn in by the charm of the character designs and the laid back feeling  you are not pressed for time and can do what you want  i spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum  creating my own house andi wouldo not understand why this game is so highly praised  after about a month of owning it i can say its  just okay when you start the game  you are drawn in by the charm of the character designs and the laid back feeling  you are not pressed for time and can do what you want  i spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum  creating my own house and trying to make money however  i then spent the next two weeks doing the exact same thing you need allot of money to progress in this game  so you are going to have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell  once you upgrade your house you are then presented with another option to upgrade  progress in the game  essentially  so you will have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell so you can get another upgrade and do the same thing again and again this isn t just limited to the main game either  filling out the museum requires you to spend hours catching fish and bugs over and over and finding fossils  you have high chances to keep getting creatures and fossils you ve found before the character dialogue  repeating  you start to notice the same dialogue being used over and over after about a week or so of playing  and while that may be fine normally this is a game that s supposed to be some sort of long term investment and is praised for its supposed  small details  and charm  which i found ran out after the first week as the game kept trying to repeat the same tricks over and over to try and impress and engage me  this game is essentially a one trick pony  after the initial  wow  there is not much left to be impressed by its fun at first but everything about this game screams repetition  its more like a chore than a fun game i cannot really recommend this game  its not the worst game i have ever played  but its just dreadfully boring  expand
2673,bought this game to play with my wife as it is supposed to support local coop  not only the local coop is a joke as the player who is not the leader basically cannot to anything but if you are not the first player to run the game and be the representative you will not get to actually play the game now i still do not have a game to play with my wife as she is nothe only one who can play it 
2674,cannot actually play the game because i was not the first player to play it will need to spend another  300 on a switch to be able to do any of the story ridiculously greedy by nintendo 
2675,bought this for my girlfriend who has really been enjoying it   however  recently we both thought it would be fun for me to make an island on my account too and were dismayed to find out that there is a one island limit per switch this is a very questionable design choice and seems borderline predatory as an attempt to pressure families into buying multiple switch consoles 
2676,horrible game that makes it impossible to enjoy for more than 1 player  gj nintendo
2677,everyone seems to be complaining about the  1 island per console  problem  which is frustrating  but since i have no one to share my console with i wouldo not have that problem  what i wouldo have a problem with is nothe game itself  it is way too grindy and does not offer me a  relaxing  experience like others claim  i find myself actually getting stressed more because i cannot find the materials ieveryone seems to be complaining about the  1 island per console  problem  which is frustrating  but since i have no one to share my console with i wouldo not have that problem  what i wouldo have a problem with is nothe game itself  it is way too grindy and does not offer me a  relaxing  experience like others claim  i find myself actually getting stressed more because i cannot find the materials i need to proceed  for example  30 iron nuggets to build the shop  there are 3 stones on my island and not 1 gave me an iron nugget  meaning i have to constantly spend nook miles to go to other islands so i can get them  it took me multiple days just to complete that task due to bad rng  and do not get me started on the 3 plot stuff 6 items per plot  and some of the materials needed for said items i cannot get on my island at all  which means more grinding for nook miles to travel to other islands for them to potentially not even have the materials i need  i just want to be able to have villagers on my island without having to constantly grind i ll give it to nintendo that the animal residents are adorable  it is why i was dragged to the game in the first place  which looking back was a huge mistake  with all the content it has  i can see why it is being sold for  50  but the gameplay itself does not make up for it  if you want a game like minecraft that has cute  interactive animal villagers and 10x more grinding for materials  then this game is absolutely for you  but sadly  it was not for me at all  expand
2678,animal crossing hasn t changed that much over time  but this notitle really rapresents the core of the franchise  chill  customize your island  have fun with friends  the graphics are stunning and the nook miles sistem works very well  i am sure that thanks to the many updates and patches that nintendo promised us  all the problems will be solved

2681,first  let me concede that the game is really fun but only if you are playing solo the fact that the progress of second and additional players is limited by the progress of the first player is a showstopper for this game ever becoming a classic   the switch offers multiple separate user profiles so that games can be  well  separate   the forced sharing of an island and the fact thatfirst  let me concede that the game is really fun but only if you are playing solo the fact that the progress of second and additional players is limited by the progress of the first player is a showstopper for this game ever becoming a classic   the switch offers multiple separate user profiles so that games can be  well  separate   the forced sharing of an island and the fact that the island rep gets game features that the other players do not get ruins the experience for any family roommates etc  that are using the same console   the option to share an island should be just that  an option   if in my own profile i want my own island with my own game experience  that should be possible   i enjoyed the game for a few hours until i realized how limited i was by being player 2 and now there is no motivation to play any further  expand
2682,throughout quarantine  this game manages to bring me and my friends together   not to mention helps us make new animal esque ones  an adorable  casual gem that can  and will  take over your life 
2683,do not buy the game if you are sharing it with a family member  or someone like that  overall  the game is great  except for one big problem which reviews are not addressing  and could be a deal breaker for some people  that is how you have to share one island per console  and only the person who arrives on the island first gets the full game experience  i wouldo not understand why nintendo woulddo not buy the game if you are sharing it with a family member  or someone like that  overall  the game is great  except for one big problem which reviews are not addressing  and could be a deal breaker for some people  that is how you have to share one island per console  and only the person who arrives on the island first gets the full game experience  i wouldo not understand why nintendo would do that  and it ruins the experience for many people including my sister who joined the island second  it just seems greedy to me  expand
2684,only one real save game is possible per switch  makes sense from a business point of view     unacceptable for customers 
2685,for the most part this game is really good but if you have one switch console in your house and have multiple people who want to play this game then it isucks for anyone who isn t the first player this is my first animal crossing game nintendo marketed the switch as a home console for families to share  so why would they make such a kid friendly game so restrictive to the other players for the most part this game is really good but if you have one switch console in your house and have multiple people who want to play this game then it isucks for anyone who isn t the first player this is my first animal crossing game nintendo marketed the switch as a home console for families to share  so why would they make such a kid friendly game so restrictive to the other players biggest   up of 2020  expand
2686,sad i have felt like i had to give this score but inevitable  i am a parent and also gamer  bought this for our whole family to play similar to how we did on new leaf  sharing islands isn t an issue for us it makes it more enjoyable  the games quaint and addictive  with one major flaw  you cannot hold multiple islands like on new leaf with game save data the saves for this game do not savesad i have felt like i had to give this score but inevitable  i am a parent and also gamer  bought this for our whole family to play similar to how we did on new leaf  sharing islands isn t an issue for us it makes it more enjoyable  the games quaint and addictive  with one major flaw  you cannot hold multiple islands like on new leaf with game save data the saves for this game do not save to profile save date or to memory cards but directly to the console meaning multiple world is completely off the table  not a huge problem some people say  well  when my 6 year old was made thiwr avatar first it became an issue   they do not play as much as myself and husband of course and us mainly being responsible for the building of the town s and helping our younger chikdren gather materials etc just became a nightmare  even more so that only the primary character can accept any quests  therefore in order to all play and build our own characters means we either have to progress our 6 year olds character beyond what they are after or sacrifice our own progression  badly thought put system  expand
2687,if i spend 60  on a new game  i expect to be fully able to play it in its fully features  it is unacceptable that you cannot create more than one island per switch  it is like fifa asking you a new xbox only to start a new career  it ishould be clearly stated that this game is for only one player and any additional player to enjoy a full experience should get a new console  that said i amif i spend 60  on a new game  i expect to be fully able to play it in its fully features  it is unacceptable that you cannot create more than one island per switch  it is like fifa asking you a new xbox only to start a new career  it ishould be clearly stated that this game is for only one player and any additional player to enjoy a full experience should get a new console  that said i am really glad i got a refund and i ll consider give this game another chance if  and only if an update comes out fix this mess  expand
2688,great game   a lot of fun   many new and old elements   highly recommended  
2689,i have bought this game for playing solo  and seeing how pretty much everyone enjoys it that way  i thought i would too  and to my disappointment  it was such a chore that it became boring after two weeks of playing some of the aspects that killed the game for me 1  grind  i initially expected the game to be kind of similar to stardew valley  there  you were always rewarded fori have bought this game for playing solo  and seeing how pretty much everyone enjoys it that way  i thought i would too  and to my disappointment  it was such a chore that it became boring after two weeks of playing some of the aspects that killed the game for me 1  grind  i initially expected the game to be kind of similar to stardew valley  there  you were always rewarded for everything  catching new species  donating items to the museum  talking and giving gifts to the villagers  aka getting cutscenes and gifts what is nothe situation like in acnh  want to travel to mystery islands  actually a one very cool feature  want some cool hairstyles  you gotta get nook miles  and in order to get them  you are given the most enjoyable tasks ever imaginable  chop 10 trees  catch 10 bugs  sell 20 weed  it was getting so tedious i wanted to cry  people actually spend 60  on this and enjoy it museum is actually really beautiful on the inside  i wouldid not expect it at first  but the sensation wears off real quick  because essentially it is all this game is about   looks  nothing rewarding in terms of gameplay 2  villagers  again  can be pretty  but they all have the same cookie cutter cutter cute and lovely personality  maybe it is me who s got so unlucky  i wouldo not know  but you can develop even characters like this  but all i got is some copy paste bs monologue about how that one likes to sleep and eat  and that other one likes to lift weights  amazing 3  the time you have to spend to do such routine like buying or selling  like honestly  do i really need  to stop to read greetings every time i walk into the shop  followed by another line when i try to talk to them  to then watch how my character hands them the goods  and they talk pointlessly optimize the menus for god s sake and stop making everything so slow  you can make immersive game without trying to artificially drag out things like selling  buying and crafting  especially when you are doing it iso frequently 4  it was actually partially my fault for not reading about the game enough  but real time synchronization is stupid  you want to build a home  a bridge  or literally anything  wait for one day  want to see new clothes  wait one day  want to have fun right now  unlucky for you  wait one day i could get behind this idea if it would not have hindered me from doing what i want when i want  why cannot i amove quickly with the game if i want to  why is nothis game forcing one play style on everyone i know you cannotime travel  which i usually do  even though it kinda feels like cheating  and you know why  because if you wouldo that  it is extremely apparent that the game relies on that real time gimmick to be interesting  it iseverely lacks any real content i believe you will enjoy the acnh if you like customizing stuff  because it is one thing the game is objectively good at all in all   i really  really tried to like this game  but you can only catch bugs for so long  expand
2690,love the game but it cannot be understated how ludicrous the one island per switch limitation is  my rating is unfair on the game but nintendo s being unfair on us  forcing us to buy another  300 system for a limitation that simply does not have to be there  imagine they only had one save for each system for the likes of mario odyssey and breath of the wild 
2691,great next step in the franchise that builds more into the game than the basic functions of the predecessors  enjoyable and addicting 
2692,the game is annoying  i wouldont want to wait for every single thing and everyone is notoo  dependent on meand its annoying that theirs same console multiplayer
2693,so disappointed with this game  starts off good with plenty to do  until you arealise that any other players on the same console have absolutely nothing to do  was looking forward to playing with the whole family but now we have all totally lost interest   update soon nintendo and only then will i change  my rating 
2694,i really enjoy the game but the decision to make player two practically useless was a big mistake  i hope nintendo makes an update so each profile can have different islands
2695,this game is amazing  i played the original  new leaf  and now this  and i can see where they upgraded its quality  it is beautiful  creative  and so original  its an all out great game  people who rate the game 0 or 2 because of its problem that you cannot own more than 1 world on 1 nintendo switch are people who have not gotten the full experience  and also ignorant people who did not thinkthis game is amazing  i played the original  new leaf  and now this  and i can see where they upgraded its quality  it is beautiful  creative  and so original  its an all out great game  people who rate the game 0 or 2 because of its problem that you cannot own more than 1 world on 1 nintendo switch are people who have not gotten the full experience  and also ignorant people who did not think to look up the details of the actual game  play singleplayer  and it is the best thing ever  i would ve rated it a ten  but no  this problem is bad and all  but a 0 or 2 rating because of the multiplayer being messed up is just not right  the game released last month  an update could be put out and could improve multiplayer  besides the one problem  this game is one of my favorites on the switch so far  expand
2696,by far the best in the animal crossing forest series  it does lack stuff to do at about two weeks in  after a certain event  that somewhat signifies the end of the tutorial if you could really call it that  but after that you will soon learn that in animal crossing  there is always something to do  the nook miles are a great addition  giving you something to do even when you are doneby far the best in the animal crossing forest series  it does lack stuff to do at about two weeks in  after a certain event  that somewhat signifies the end of the tutorial if you could really call it that  but after that you will soon learn that in animal crossing  there is always something to do  the nook miles are a great addition  giving you something to do even when you are done with your daily chores  which only consist of the usual animal crossing activities such as fishing and catching bugs  doing favors etc  it ishould also be noted that the game improves upon new leaf in a variety of ways  for instance the sound design is spectacular  one of the best sounding games on the switch system  if not the best overall  there are some things however that are cause for controversy  such as the local multiplayer issue  in which the leader is pretty much the only one who gets to do anything  while any one else can collect materials  they go to the recycling bin in the resident services tent building  which is fine till you arealize that anyone can access that  and take the other players stuff  and to top it off the second player cannot take it till either they are the leader  or they boot up the game by themselves  another setback is nothe exclusion of cloud saves backups  while nintendo has stated that there will be a way to get your island back in the case of console loss or theft  it has not to my knowledge been implemented yet  so basically  for now say your console got stolen  you would lose all of your progress  and as someone who has accidentally lost their save game  it is not a great time building back up what you lost  so  in conclusion the game is sub par  just kidding this is nothe best selling animal crossing for a reason  if you have the means to purchase this game do  you will not regret it  just keep in mind some of the disappointing aspects of the game  and try to keep your console itself safe  i know that times are rough right now  so i just wanted to say to any one who actually reads this  if you cannot afford the game do not go out of your way to buy it  save your money for food and other living costs  stay safe  and have fun  expand
2697,originally this game scored close to a 10 10 for me  due to the poor design choices for multiplayer  i am  3 weeks into this game and unable to expand my island or complete any of the main goals of the game   the first player to play the game is nothe only player who has any control and the only player who can ultimately play the game to its fullest  i was the second person to start the gameoriginally this game scored close to a 10 10 for me  due to the poor design choices for multiplayer  i am  3 weeks into this game and unable to expand my island or complete any of the main goals of the game   the first player to play the game is nothe only player who has any control and the only player who can ultimately play the game to its fullest  i was the second person to start the game in my house  and i am the only one currently playing it  however  there is no ability to delete users or switch who the main resident is  this game lacks the proper communication to users before playing   had i known this was the way the game worked  my boyfriend would not have started playing first  now  i amust either completely start over and lose all of my progress and hard work i have put into this game  or i amust log on to his account and play both of our accounts to ensure i can actually complete goals and expand  i am actually quite surprised with how overlooked this design was by nintendo   extremely disappointing  expand
2698,people are being way to bad on this game  yeah  being limited per console sucks  but otherwise it is probably the best animal crossing game in the series 
2699,made this account specifically to warn people about the nefarious business tactics that are underpinning the cute aesthetics if you plan on playing this game with other people in your household on a single switch then think again as that really isn t possible  only 1 game island per switch  not per profile  additional profiles can only visit the 1st players game and cannot start theirmade this account specifically to warn people about the nefarious business tactics that are underpinning the cute aesthetics if you plan on playing this game with other people in your household on a single switch then think again as that really isn t possible  only 1 game island per switch  not per profile  additional profiles can only visit the 1st players game and cannot start their own  this is a conscious design decision by nintendo to try and force households to purchase a console for every member of household  so it is not  50 for the game  it is actually the amount of people in your household x  50    200  a rip off basically sort it out nintendo  you know you ve done this deliberately and could easily fix it  expand
2700,absolutely infuriating  you put out a solid game and give it garbage restrictions  one island per console  how greedy are you  as if your popular system and popular game are not enough  you need force people who want their own island in a household to have their own system  what kind of communism is nothis  trash  upset that i purchased and already opened it 
2701,i spent 60 e on the game and also had to buy a memory card to be able to download it  now it turned out that only one profile can own an island and others are just guests  so now i have one happy kid and one sad  i am very disappointed at nintendo  they better fix it  it is 2020   there isurely are not any technical restrictions preventing each profile from having an own island 
2702,this is a review that comes from a secondary user of the game while the game in itself is fantastic  peaceful and brilliant  i have never been more disappointed by a game  this probably comes as my partner and i were excited for this game to come out for a long time  the unfortunate truth is nothat you  cannot create multiple island for multiple users  this is absolutely disappointing asthis is a review that comes from a secondary user of the game while the game in itself is fantastic  peaceful and brilliant  i have never been more disappointed by a game  this probably comes as my partner and i were excited for this game to come out for a long time  the unfortunate truth is nothat you  cannot create multiple island for multiple users  this is absolutely disappointing as it ishows how much nintendo wants people to buy more of its products  i have never given a review before and i am extremely sadden by the fact the developers completely ruined the game for me as i cannot have my own story  my own adventure  it only leaves a bitter feeling in your mouse  expand
2703,i really liked the overall game but i just cannot get past the game only having one island per console  i would be totally fine with sharing the island with my kid if both of us could complete main story quests but only the first player to establish the island gets to progress the story  so even though i created my own character on the same island   all i can do is collect things and wait fori really liked the overall game but i just cannot get past the game only having one island per console  i would be totally fine with sharing the island with my kid if both of us could complete main story quests but only the first player to establish the island gets to progress the story  so even though i created my own character on the same island   all i can do is collect things and wait for the first player to eventually progress the island  it makes it where i wouldo not even want to play anymore because what is nothe point  just a terribly stupid choice from nintendo that will probable turn me off these games for good  expand
2704,1st of all no way this game is a 10 but neither is it a 0 the game is relaxing and a good way to chill and out get your creative mind going to see what ideas you can come up with for your island and it can be good fun  and building your museum collection up with insects and fish is nicely done and good to see your efforts displayed  the fossils part is done well and actually displays1st of all no way this game is a 10 but neither is it a 0 the game is relaxing and a good way to chill and out get your creative mind going to see what ideas you can come up with for your island and it can be good fun  and building your museum collection up with insects and fish is nicely done and good to see your efforts displayed  the fossils part is done well and actually displays them in a chronological and evolutional order which is fun to discover and i am sure kids will love it     however this lasts about a week and then after that it istarts to wear a bit thin i have no problem with the real time aspect of the game per say  i also dolt mind the accelerated clock in stardew vally both have their merits  however i wouldo feel like it was done to extend the life of the game  and the repetitive nature of the game does become a bit boring you will find yourself just doing the same menial tasks over and over for little or no reward  at times it does feel like a mobile game you have paid  50 for to play on a  300 console  also it is 2020 nintendo why is it not a fully 3d game  not being able to rotate the camera 360 degrees  i amean come on not being able to craft more than 1 thing at a time is also annoying i have 8 clams and i want to make 8 fish bait  i cannot just select make 8 and it does it  no you have to go through the same process and animation 8 times  the islands you visit via nook miles will soon become repetitive as seems to be limited to about 10  different layouts i have visited the same island 3 times in 2 days  6000 miles well spent the dialog with your island buddies soon becomes irritating as they just repeat the same lines over and over and do not really offer anything  multiplayer is a mess why cannot i open my gate and my friends just pop over  no i have to sit through the same loading screen and animation for every person that visits and same when they leave plus when they are arrive there is nothing to do  no mini games or anything to do together which is a shame  i have also knocked a point off for the 1 island per console stroke that nintendo have pulled just to try and sell more units   luckily me and my wife are happy to share a character so in our house it is not an issue but i can see how it could cause problems  the tools breaking without any warning is also frustrating  why no status bar  we had this in minecraft a game that was made in what 2007  and gold tools should not break  i have worked hard for them and the they just break  it ishould be a reward for all your hard work  i wouldo not want to seem like i am just moaning about the game as i have had fun playing it and i think of your prepared to look past the annoyances there is a good game in there  and it is a break from the normal fps action fifa style games  i just wish a bit more thought was put into the ui and quality of life of the player  i also have a sneaking suspicion that micro transactions are on the way as it is a game primed for it but i hope i am wrong would have got a 7 10 from me if it was not for the 1 island per switch idea  i think 6 10 is a fair score  expand
2705,please please please add more custom design slots  this limitation is majorly affecting my enjoyment of the game  and will be the reason i stop playing  i cannot continue to customize my island without a lot more design slots  they fill up so fast and if i wouldelete one to add another  the design changes in the game  i have stalled out on game play and the only enjoyable part left isplease please please add more custom design slots  this limitation is majorly affecting my enjoyment of the game  and will be the reason i stop playing  i cannot continue to customize my island without a lot more design slots  they fill up so fast and if i wouldelete one to add another  the design changes in the game  i have stalled out on game play and the only enjoyable part left is customization and now i cannot continue that either  expand
2706,this review would basically be the same as the other negative review on here  so just read the majority of them  to put my on review though i would say this game is good  i have so far enjoyed my experience and that s as a solo player even then i am disappointed in the solo save feature  i have seen that apparently having 8 people on one island is multiple saves but that isn t true  that sthis review would basically be the same as the other negative review on here  so just read the majority of them  to put my on review though i would say this game is good  i have so far enjoyed my experience and that s as a solo player even then i am disappointed in the solo save feature  i have seen that apparently having 8 people on one island is multiple saves but that isn t true  that s one save for multiple people  i can see that critic reviews are positive and i can only imagine that they will not actually play this game like most intend or like family with one console for the family  silly idea for a brilliant game  and all for the money  very sad  expand
2707,this game har amazing potential but the experience is absolutely 100  ruined for a couple who shares one switch  solely because of the 1 island per console combined with the ridiculous second resident restrictions  i would accept the fact that we have to share one island together but not the fact that 2nd player doesnt get to play the game  either we  should be able to have seperatethis game har amazing potential but the experience is absolutely 100  ruined for a couple who shares one switch  solely because of the 1 island per console combined with the ridiculous second resident restrictions  i would accept the fact that we have to share one island together but not the fact that 2nd player doesnt get to play the game  either we  should be able to have seperate islands for each user or let all residents have full access to the shared island  expand
2708,i have never played an animal crossing game before and decided to play this one for the first time  big mistake  the fact that we get such a tiny island that we are forced to share it with other profiles is ridiculous  i cannot enjoy the experience when someone else is notaking all the resources and they cannot enjoy the experience because i cannot play often enough to advance the game  even ifi have never played an animal crossing game before and decided to play this one for the first time  big mistake  the fact that we get such a tiny island that we are forced to share it with other profiles is ridiculous  i cannot enjoy the experience when someone else is notaking all the resources and they cannot enjoy the experience because i cannot play often enough to advance the game  even if we did delete the save file and start in their profile  it does not help because i still would not be able to do anything without resources  this is nothe stupidest concept to force upon people and a giant waste of money  i feel ripped off and i want my money back  expand

2710,only one island per console  why  if there are several people in the family  then you have to play on the same island  nintendo i am disappointed 
2711,the game itself is fine  animal crossing looks amazing in hd and it is still good to play with friends  however  the game itself really could have used more time in the oven  while i wouldo not share an island with anyone on my switch  i still see that it is a major problem with co op and i will acknowledge that nintendo did consumers dirty with that move  one of the game s main draws  the diythe game itself is fine  animal crossing looks amazing in hd and it is still good to play with friends  however  the game itself really could have used more time in the oven  while i wouldo not share an island with anyone on my switch  i still see that it is a major problem with co op and i will acknowledge that nintendo did consumers dirty with that move  one of the game s main draws  the diy crafting system  takes up a lot of the game and unfortunately to its detriment  new horizons has undoubtedly the slowest start out of every game in the series  even slower than new leaf  the diy system not helping at all  considering all of the materials one must gather and furniture they must build just to get the first few neighbors to move in  not to mention that said materials are not kept in their own separate inventory  same with tools  and as a result  inventory space gets eaten up surprisingly quick  even with the upgrade  speaking of tools  they are handled in the worst way possible  any tool can now break after enough use  now while that does not sound like anything new  there is actually no indication of when they will break  unlike breath of the wild  there is no notice of any kind when they will break  so it can easily happen out of nowhere  forcing you to have to run back to a diy bench and craft a new one after getting the necessary materials for it  even the golden tools are breakable  which as a series staple of being some of the best tools to use in the games  devalues them by a lot  even the golden axe breaks  which has always been known to be indestructible  which gave players a huge incentive to get it  but in new horizons  it is just only a grade above a regular axe  as silver tools are nowhere to be seen either  also  who at nintendo was in charge of the fish spawn rates  black bass and sea bass have always been known to be annoyingly common as some kind of running joke in the series  however said joke has run its course to the ground real hard in this installment  they tend to spawn way more often than in any other game in the series  making some fish an absolute chore to try and get  and it cannoturn what was supposed to be a relaxing experience into complete and utter frustration  also  certain upgrades and buildings take way too long to complete  the museum probably being the most notorious as of writing this  as blathers took forever to open up thus making players have to hoard their catches for days until he finally opened up the building  not to mention that some characters have been found in the game s code  yet are not in the game and are clearly meant for post launch updates  yet new leaf already had these from the start  speaking of post launch updates  this game needs them as soon as possible  there are some heavy quality of life changes that new horizons can use and for the better  as it istands as of writing this  new leaf is still easily the better game  at least when you had the campsite in that game  you wouldid not have to invite them via amiibo three separate times to get them to move in  and you wouldid not have to craft something for them each time  especially any diy recipes involving shells  those being some of the worst because of the bad spawn rng  hopefully  nintendo responds in kind and gives the game the treatment that it deserves as an entry in this beloved franchise  expand

2717,wow best game of the year   so much replay value it is insane   and now with this new nature event there is even more stuff to do   even the island vendor had some special things i have really be needing for my gardens   i am just so in love with this game      replay value 
2718,a wonderfully relaxing  peaceful and unique video game experience that will not be to everyone s taste  but for its target audience it will be like a dream come true 
2719,something i have never seen in any game before  only 1 player is allowed to fully play this game per console  congratulations on the most idiotic element i have ever seen in any video game 
2720,to start  this game is incredibly fun at its base  but there are some truly asinine decisions made by nintendo here that simply should not be accepted in a modern game  they do not deserve to be praised like they are being for hurting customers with bad and artificial restrictions  the good  this game is  as far as straight gameplay goes  truly wonderful  it is everything animal crossing wasto start  this game is incredibly fun at its base  but there are some truly asinine decisions made by nintendo here that simply should not be accepted in a modern game  they do not deserve to be praised like they are being for hurting customers with bad and artificial restrictions  the good  this game is  as far as straight gameplay goes  truly wonderful  it is everything animal crossing was meant to be and it retains the heart of the series  while it is missing quite a few of the features previous games had  updates look to be coming regularly to bring it up to par  looking at you aredd and lief from the recent update  it is charming  has lasting appeal  and has enough to do that even past the first few weeks you will want to pick it up every day  the eh  people with odd hours may want to set their time zone to a more traditional time before playing  i tend to be up at odd hours due to my job and on a lot of days that means i am not allowed to sell items at full price  sell turnips  buy clothes  talk to most of my neighbors  or catch certain fish bugs  time travel still works in this game but turnips will spoil if you wouldo  the nature of the game dictates that you have things tied to time but give nighttime players more to do  if i happen to be only able to play at 1 am one night i should be relegated to only resident services and the museum  with the occasional visit from whisp the bad  if you want to play this game with anybody other than yourself  you are looking at the most tedious and unnecessary multiplayer system known to man  a long animation is required for each player visiting your item  it requires you to exit all menus and failure to do so means the visitor cannot come  if more than one person try to visit at the same time  at least one will get an error and have to keep trying  it makes visiting with friends incredibly difficult  if you want to have anybody else in your household play the game look forward to buying more switches because the only option is noto share your island  that does not sound so bad except only one person gets the full experience  my mom wanted to play so she got her own tent on my island  since i have been playing for weeks though  she gets zero build up  far fewer nook miles  zero instruction past a handful of things  and she needs me for a lot of major island additions like houses  why cannot it be an option to create a separate save file for each person  i am guessing that good old fashioned nintendo greed has to do with it  it is not enough to pay up to  300 for a console and another  60 for a game i would bet will never see a sale  if you want to have the full experience for everybody in your house on a so called family console  you will need to shell out at minimum  260 for a switch lite and another copy of ac to give just one more person  also  speaking of my mother  i went to visit her for a week and went to change my time zone to hers so we could get the standard experience  that means that all 800 000 bells worth of turnips that i had spoiled  i live in eastern time and she lives in central  any time travel backward means your turnips spoil  look i get it  time travelers do not get to game the turnip market  but i am not manually setting my time here  just updating a time zone to reflect where i am at physically  but that makes me a dirty cheater apparently and i am being punished as such  what else could possibly be wrong here you ask  how about zero cloud save support despite the promise it d be added  shortly  after launch  how about no bulk crafting for items you will definitely need in bulk  how about the first major event completely ruining some of the best part of the game by turning everything into eggs  this game could ve been perfect  and i know some of those gripes may not mean much to some  but it is a serious disappointment to me coming back to the series for the first time in a long time to see it turned into a frustrating version of perfection   i have zero hope nintendo will do the right thing and fix most of these issues  this is why i tend to stay away from nintendo  every time i give them another shot they take my money and give me half a product  shame on them  but shame on me too for trusting them  and for playing this game still  despite everything it is still too fun to put down  even if i am incredibly frustrated  that s why it gets a 4 and not a 0  but there ishould be a warning on every box about all the ways nintendo will force you to have fun on their terms and not your own  expand
2721,everyone in my family chipped in to buy this game but now in turns out that only one of us can really play it 
2722,this score is for playing the game when you are a second class citizen  if you happen to be the first person in your family who boots up the game  great  you will have a better experience everyone else who wants to play on the console  you are out of luck  you will not be able to play the game to its full extent  the one island per console limitation is probably one of the worst decisionsthis score is for playing the game when you are a second class citizen  if you happen to be the first person in your family who boots up the game  great  you will have a better experience everyone else who wants to play on the console  you are out of luck  you will not be able to play the game to its full extent  the one island per console limitation is probably one of the worst decisions ever made in gaming  on top of that  only the main player can advance the island  not knowing this  i spent a lot of time thinking there was a major bug in the game  when i found out it was a feature  i was surprised and not in a good way it is not likely it is because of a switch technical limitation  as the switch is able to maintain separate save files for every profile for just about every other game  including games more complex than animal crossing this is just a poor design decision or a bad tactic to try to sell more consoles  seems nintendo dreams of every person in a family having their own switch  well guess what  not going to happen  just going to get tons of negative reviews instead  expand
2723,this game is good but it is just overhyped by the critics and i got tricked to buy and play this game to find nothing special with it
2724,this would be a great game if nintendo would just fix the ridiculous multiplayer mode and the only one island problem   my kids just want to sit and play it together with a split iscreen where they can all make decisions   let them each have their own island or stop advertising this as a multiplayer game   as is  it is nothing more than a source of constant frustration for everyone exceptthis would be a great game if nintendo would just fix the ridiculous multiplayer mode and the only one island problem   my kids just want to sit and play it together with a split iscreen where they can all make decisions   let them each have their own island or stop advertising this as a multiplayer game   as is  it is nothing more than a source of constant frustration for everyone except the first player   nintendo  fix your game  expand
2725,i bought this game to play with my wife but the one island limitation is ridicules  her experience was very limited because i got to play it first  the second player has nothingto do on the island  we wanted to have separated islands to compare decorations and stuff but  guess what  only if one of us buy a new console and game   no   way  the game itself is awesome  but this is ai bought this game to play with my wife but the one island limitation is ridicules  her experience was very limited because i got to play it first  the second player has nothingto do on the island  we wanted to have separated islands to compare decorations and stuff but  guess what  only if one of us buy a new console and game   no   way  the game itself is awesome  but this is a deal breaker for me  expand
2726,being limited to a single island ruins this game   i should not ever even have to wonder if a game can be played with different accounts   it is common sense   i just bought a switch  which was a horrible experience with the current stock shortage  specifically so my wife and i can each play this game  have our own islands  and share our individual experiences   my jaw is still laying on thebeing limited to a single island ruins this game   i should not ever even have to wonder if a game can be played with different accounts   it is common sense   i just bought a switch  which was a horrible experience with the current stock shortage  specifically so my wife and i can each play this game  have our own islands  and share our individual experiences   my jaw is still laying on the floor after learning that you are stuck with a single island that all users must share   i am not even given the  bad  option of buying a second copy of the game to open up the option for a 2nd island   this is an awful  awful design decision   if the motivation is noto stop cheating  first of all  why would the devs care if somebody is cheating at a single player life simulator   ruining the experience for multiple players within the household only creates a bigger problem   until this game is patched with a reasonable option for individual players on the same console to have their own individual experiences  this game is worthless to me and many others   the entire premise of this game is having your own island and making it yours   this is a horrible  horrible move that needs fixed immediately  expand
2727,i really like this game  and personally for myself alone it is a 10 10  but the fact that my roomate cannot play the game at all mean s it is a very valid 0  i have read people saying that a 0 is non nonsensical  however  this is a game play rating  and this setup allows for literally 0 game for him to play  how is nothat not a 0  roaming around my island with nothing to do is not a game  it is ani really like this game  and personally for myself alone it is a 10 10  but the fact that my roomate cannot play the game at all mean s it is a very valid 0  i have read people saying that a 0 is non nonsensical  however  this is a game play rating  and this setup allows for literally 0 game for him to play  how is nothat not a 0  roaming around my island with nothing to do is not a game  it is an interactive museum at best  coincidentally  this game has an amazing museum set up i wouldigress  assuming you are actually able to play it  it is a very good game  super fun to build up an island  collecting artifacts is surprisingly fun  i am in the end game and having the ability to terraform is amazing  i love creating things  and hunting for bugs and fish  i also love visiting friends  outside my own household  islands and snagging fruits i wouldo not have any who  if there is a 1 1 1 ratio between people who are going to be playing  game cartridges owned  and game consoles owned  i highly suggest it  especially if you have friends who play it  if that ratio is off  there is no way i can suggest it  it is too good to not be able to share fully  expand

2730,pretty short sighted and money hungry to force households to have 1 island per console  every other game on the switch allows multiple saves except this one  just shows nintendo is no better than the rest of the shady aaa gaming industry 
2731,locked to a single island per console in a disgusting money grabbing attempt from nintendo  also a stupid game in general  who likes doing chores to get out of debt from a raccoon  plebians 
2732,this game would be a 10 but there is one huge flaw  nintendo refuses to let you have a different island per user  and will require you to purchase another console  this  paired with the lack of cloud saves is a very scummy choice by nintendo  other than that good game but the anticonsumerist approach to this release  especially when consoles are incredibly difficult to get ahold of  leavesthis game would be a 10 but there is one huge flaw  nintendo refuses to let you have a different island per user  and will require you to purchase another console  this  paired with the lack of cloud saves is a very scummy choice by nintendo  other than that good game but the anticonsumerist approach to this release  especially when consoles are incredibly difficult to get ahold of  leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and i cant recommend for those reasons alone  expand
2733,if you have more than 1 person in your house  do not bother buying this game  you can only have 1 island per switch  very  very hard to enjoy the game at the beginning  not being able to skip cut scenes and skip dialogue kills me  if you wouldo have to share an island  the person who did not make the island does not have control over anything  you pretty much just gather resources  veryif you have more than 1 person in your house  do not bother buying this game  you can only have 1 island per switch  very  very hard to enjoy the game at the beginning  not being able to skip cut scenes and skip dialogue kills me  if you wouldo have to share an island  the person who did not make the island does not have control over anything  you pretty much just gather resources  very disappointed that such a promising game was ruined by nintendo being petty and greedy  will never play again  expand

2737,it is my first dip in the series and i am shocked at how much i am loving it  does not seem like the type of game i would be interested in but could not recommend it enough and i am glad i tried it 
2738,a very decent game  i wouldo not know what the complaint of having one island per switch is all about no such thing as free lunch in this world and definitely there is no such thing as buying one ticket for the whole family whenever you enter places like disneyland  you can share the game just fine  you wouldo not need two islands  you can share a car but remember when you pay for the car youa very decent game  i wouldo not know what the complaint of having one island per switch is all about no such thing as free lunch in this world and definitely there is no such thing as buying one ticket for the whole family whenever you enter places like disneyland  you can share the game just fine  you wouldo not need two islands  you can share a car but remember when you pay for the car you only get one when you have only got money for the price of one  expand

2740,in an animal subjected game  when almost everyone had asked how to remove animals on my island  the game must be a failure 
2741,seriously it is 2020 this one save slot nonsense needs to go  this isn t one island per profile  not one island per cartridge  but it is one island per switch console  this is just greedy horse crap there is zero reason to have one island per console  the game play is good  but this island limit kills the entire experience for me  and just makes me furious not to mention that only theseriously it is 2020 this one save slot nonsense needs to go  this isn t one island per profile  not one island per cartridge  but it is one island per switch console  this is just greedy horse crap there is zero reason to have one island per console  the game play is good  but this island limit kills the entire experience for me  and just makes me furious not to mention that only the first player to create the island is allowed to progress it iso the second player cannot even do anything meaningful  expand
2742,the whole point of getting this game was to enjoy playing together  nintendo is just being greedy when they require you to buy two switches  and two copies of the game to play co op with your spouse  i wanted to share and island with my wife  as this game was supposed to be our minecraft substitute  that s not gonna happen now  but nintendo already has my money now  no luck getting it backthe whole point of getting this game was to enjoy playing together  nintendo is just being greedy when they require you to buy two switches  and two copies of the game to play co op with your spouse  i wanted to share and island with my wife  as this game was supposed to be our minecraft substitute  that s not gonna happen now  but nintendo already has my money now  no luck getting it back either  not with their no refunds ever policy  expand
2743,the local co op is an absolute joke  also  if you are not the first player to create a character on the island  you are pretty much shafted  you will have no way of progressing through the story or make changes to the island  there is not even a way to make multiple islands on the same switch  basically  if you are not player one  this game is completely unplayable
2744,although the one island per console restriction can  understandably  be annoying for families and people sharing a switch  i believe that the game is still a wonderful package for any animal crossing fan 
2745,i grew up with animal crossing  from wild world to new leaf i could not miss out on new horizons  i played the game the day it released and it is become part of my daily schedule ever since then  the game offers a peaceful getaway from the stress of the real world and allows you to turn a deserted island into your own personal paradise  like minecraft once said  the only limit is youri grew up with animal crossing  from wild world to new leaf i could not miss out on new horizons  i played the game the day it released and it is become part of my daily schedule ever since then  the game offers a peaceful getaway from the stress of the real world and allows you to turn a deserted island into your own personal paradise  like minecraft once said  the only limit is your creativity  and that fits perfectly for this game  almost unlimited design options from planting flowers to terraforming mountains and waterfalls allows players to practically play god and do whatever their heart desires  the start of the game is a bit islow and tedious as players try to get all the buildings and upgrades so you can do as you will  the core part of the game is building a community with these adorable animals that will populate your town that have their own personalities and preferences  featuring many popular returning faces including tom nook  timmy and tommy  isabelle  able sisters  leif and many more you are bound to reunite with your childhood favorites  collecting different rare fish  bugs  and fossils is a main component of the game and can be  annoying  at times but makes you feel accomplished apon collection  multiplayer is something i use frequently in the game and i have discovered it to be  boring  no mini games  annoying communication  and limited interaction forces players to come up with their own things to do  or just awkwardly stand next to each other and doing emotes  multiplayer is good for trading but that s honestly about it from what i have personally experienced  in a game where you can do almost anything there is something for everyone here and can bring some peace to even the rowdiest of souls  with no violence  swears  drugs  or sexual references this is almost a  shell shock  being seen as one of the best selling games of the year so far  this game allows me to stress out about where to put my flowers instead of stressing out about deadlines and drama and is a nice feeling that only this game can deliver  i can see this being part of my daily schedule for months to come and i always look forward to what new exciting thing will happen on my island each day  expand
2746,the game was fun to play for the first few hours but this game requires a lot of time to farming collect furnitures and diy recipes  and the real time game system is very inconvenient 
2747,compre el juego para jugar con mi novio  resulta que solo el usuario principal disfruta de todo y hace crecer la isla  me parece una estafa gigante  estoy muy disconforme con la compra 
2748,the one island per switch  rather than one island per profile is a terrible  terrible design decision from nintendo  i cannot see how it is anything more than a poorly disguised attempt to force people to buy a second switch console 
2749,only one person can enjoy the game on the same console  only the first player can make progress  the second gets the leftovers  shame on you  nintendo 
2750,only one island per console  nintendo needs to rethink this strategy  i for one will double think when buying nintendo games in the future  that includes consoles 
2751,it pains me to score this game so low  i have actually really enjoyed the first two weeks of gameplay and have been waiting for its release since it was announced it retains all the likeable features of the older games in the series and adds a variety of new mechanics and experiences that makes it feel so refreshing to play  easily a 10 10 in that regard however myself and  as evidentit pains me to score this game so low  i have actually really enjoyed the first two weeks of gameplay and have been waiting for its release since it was announced it retains all the likeable features of the older games in the series and adds a variety of new mechanics and experiences that makes it feel so refreshing to play  easily a 10 10 in that regard however myself and  as evident from the user score distribution above  50  of the player base were the unlucky ones  how  let me braked down why this game failed so many people 1  shared console  shared islandnow i personally do not mind sharing my animal crossing world with my brother  creating an aesthetic together and foraging really harks back to our childhood  the option to play simultaneously on the one screen is also a great  much needed addition to the series  but why isn t it optional nintendo decided that each switch console will be limited to one island per system  that means if you and whoever you may share your console with want to play this game  you will be forced to live together on the island indefinitely  all island data is stored locally on the console  so no amount of   spent on separate game cartridges will ever solve this  so if you want a different island  you will need another console and another copy of the game the switch is nothe most powerful and innovative nintendo system to date  with a default storage of 32gb  animal crossing new horizons is 6 4gb before any save data is stored  and after a combined playtime of 60hrs between myself and my brother  the game now takes up 6 5gb of our total storage  an additional 100mb for two accounts and a whole island  that s it  surely each account could have the option to share an island or have one to themselves  this is so disheartening as this is such a primitive move by nintendo  but it is not even the worst first in  first servednow the whole appeal of this new game was the fact that you were no longer limited to only decorating the interior of your home  placing buildings wherever you want  inviting residents to your town  starting construction on bridges and ramps  the ability to carve rivers into the landscape   if you were the first user to play the game on your shared console any person who decides to join your island after you will be almost indefinitely restricted to shaking trees  fishing  and popping balloons  yes of course there are a few more features to play with and enjoy  but how long will these last before they become tedious for player 2 unfortunately i was the second user to join a new horizons island and as i approach my 50th hour of gameplay  i am beginning to feel ripped off  for any progression to happen to our island requires my brother  player 1  to play the game as much as i wouldo so that he gets the prompt to upgrade the shop  or place a new building  or build a new bridge  and what happens when my bother loses interest in the game  will i have to consistently log him in and out to progress  will i have to restart our island  there is a sense of pride and individuality that you hold for your unique villager  swapping to my brother s villager to receive building privileges would allow me to build the things i want  but deep down i feel i am being stripped of achievement and that my villager is basically useless with these setbacks i believe the game only deserves a 2 10  but i am holding onto a hope that in a future update nintendo will fix these issues for their otherwise perfect game  expand

2764,the perfect game during a stupid pandemic  my only gripe is what a lot of the lame brigading reviews mention  and that is nothat the account that starts the island ends up gatekeeping improvements  for anyone playing completely solo  locally  this isn t a problem  as a household of 3  my kid was first and now we have to play as her when she isn t interested in island management  personally ithe perfect game during a stupid pandemic  my only gripe is what a lot of the lame brigading reviews mention  and that is nothat the account that starts the island ends up gatekeeping improvements  for anyone playing completely solo  locally  this isn t a problem  as a household of 3  my kid was first and now we have to play as her when she isn t interested in island management  personally i am ok with just having the one island  however  the management side of things should have been extended to all players and not just the first one this does not ruin the game completely and it is still a great successor to the series  hopefully the devs can constructively move forward with an update that allows people to start easier  i wish i had known this limitation on launch day  but we stayed away from too much info so we did not spoil the initial fun and no one wants to reset your stuff after a few days of work already got put in the community of designers is pretty awesome and both my wife and daughter love customizing their homes with the shared designs  expand
2765,the game is by far the best animal crossing  it takes every animal crossing game   expands upon it  which is everything we ask for in sequels  however my only complaint is it is not innovative for this day   age  the first animal crossing will always be timeless because of what it was for it is time  still  new horizons does not disappoint 
2766,do not let a review bomb discourage you from playing this game  nay  this work of art 
2767,review bombing a game doing well is not cool and i hope metacritic staff do something about this 
2768,perfect  i have funny moments in all time with my family and solitarie  i recommend this game for all that want relax
2769,wonderful game that you areally get sucked into  honestly nintendo came out with this game at the perfect time 
2770,awesome game fantástico para jugar un par de horas diarias  muy recomendable
2771,tengo que admitir que es un juego adictivo  nunca había jugado animal crossing  pero si juegos parecidos  y la verdad me encanta  el estilo visual si no es el mejor pero a la vista de verdad te encanta  la manera en que funciona estoy pegado a el todos los días  es un juegazo para los que les gusta este genero lo recomiendo
2772,a wide improvement over all the other installments  and they even let you bring in the cards from the tragic wii u party game 
2773,es mi primer animal crossing pero me parece muy bien juego  relaja  es bastante completo  podría estar mejor pero es mejorable y posible que sea actualizado en un futuro 
2774,this is one of the few honest reviews of animal crossing new horizons you will see  it is not amazing  it is not terrible  it has its moments and is certainly a different type of game than you might be used to  very little in the way of an objective  very relaxing  very annoying in terms of repeated dialogue and some awkward controls it is relaxing in a kind of  do nothing  way and it is allthis is one of the few honest reviews of animal crossing new horizons you will see  it is not amazing  it is not terrible  it has its moments and is certainly a different type of game than you might be used to  very little in the way of an objective  very relaxing  very annoying in terms of repeated dialogue and some awkward controls it is relaxing in a kind of  do nothing  way and it is all innocent and charming and a nice non threatening world to dip into now and again  but it is not exactly thrill filled or the kind of challenge you will get from a typical game i could not care less about multiple players because i am the only one who plays on my switch  but if you share your console  your mileage might vary  does not deserve a 10  certainly does not deserve a 0  solid 7 10 game  expand
2775,fun game to pass time  especially in the current climate of world lock downs   ignore the zero ratings   a zero rating should be reserved for games that do not even boot up  any zeros you see are just from people being petty over a particular feature they do not like  those things are not game breaking just annoyances   i would have really rated this game a 9 for lack of multiple islands butfun game to pass time  especially in the current climate of world lock downs   ignore the zero ratings   a zero rating should be reserved for games that do not even boot up  any zeros you see are just from people being petty over a particular feature they do not like  those things are not game breaking just annoyances   i would have really rated this game a 9 for lack of multiple islands but threw it up to 10  to counteract the other reviews  expand
2776,never got into ac before this release  have had a lot of fun with this game  it is a game i can enjoy with both my wife and daughter without much fuss  easy to pick up for quick bites and also easy to sit down and kill a ton of time messing about  some of the tools controls can be a bit wonky  and the single island per system thing keep this from getting a higher score from me  tl dr  fun never got into ac before this release  have had a lot of fun with this game  it is a game i can enjoy with both my wife and daughter without much fuss  easy to pick up for quick bites and also easy to sit down and kill a ton of time messing about  some of the tools controls can be a bit wonky  and the single island per system thing keep this from getting a higher score from me  tl dr  fun  enjoyable with family and friends  couple of odd bits keep it from being amazing  expand
2777,really chill game that lets you wouldo whatever feels like it could relieve your stress  with a wonderful atmosphere and adorable aesthetics you can enjoy your own life on a deserted island  this was the first animal crossing game i bought and i honestly did not see the appeal before  after playing i can finally say that seeing your island life progress with new animal friends and your ownreally chill game that lets you wouldo whatever feels like it could relieve your stress  with a wonderful atmosphere and adorable aesthetics you can enjoy your own life on a deserted island  this was the first animal crossing game i bought and i honestly did not see the appeal before  after playing i can finally say that seeing your island life progress with new animal friends and your own creativity shine to show for others or simply for yourself is a fun thing  i have not even started to play with friends yet but i can imagine that will make the game even more enjoyable  expand
2778,despite everyone here talking about how the first player is nothe main one principle is bad and ruins fun  i actually kinda see  what nintendo intended with it through i wouldo not think it fully works  every other player has to ask first one  if they want new bridge  move some house and e t c and raise money together for it  i am playing with my brother with me as the first player and hedespite everyone here talking about how the first player is nothe main one principle is bad and ruins fun  i actually kinda see  what nintendo intended with it through i wouldo not think it fully works  every other player has to ask first one  if they want new bridge  move some house and e t c and raise money together for it  i am playing with my brother with me as the first player and he does not find that too problematic  expand
2779,honestly  i am not qualified to review this game as i never do this  it is notrue 1 island per console is really disappointing but not surprising from nintendo  i have never played ac before this game  and i used to hate on this game but now that i have played it  i cannot stop  this game does not deserve the hate it is getting  it is a great  fun and addicting game anyone can play and have fun with 
2780,adorable and fun  this game is not for players looking for constant action  it is a very relaxing and slow paced game  a big step forward for the animal crossing series 
2781,awesome game  fantastic visuals and a very calming aesthetic  it makes for the perfect saturday evening 
2782,great game  i have to admit that the one island per switch isn t the best  but it is not that big of a deal as i am the main person to play on it  but it would be nice to at least have the option to 
2783,it is very fun and relaxing  i enjoy the many ways to customize my player character  and the island i live on 
2784,basically it is a really good game  the fact that it is shared on console is a tiny factor of negativity in a great game  it builds on previous editions of the game  not tearing it down  people need to find a hobby other than wantonly down voting something for no reason  the people with legit concerns  like the shared console issues  are perfectly understandable  especially if you havebasically it is a really good game  the fact that it is shared on console is a tiny factor of negativity in a great game  it builds on previous editions of the game  not tearing it down  people need to find a hobby other than wantonly down voting something for no reason  the people with legit concerns  like the shared console issues  are perfectly understandable  especially if you have children in your home that do whatever they want  or the people who want their own island  regardless  the game is still good  if you liked the other games  i cannot see a reason for why you would t like this one  other than the said console issues  idk  people suck and honestly i would rather communicate with animal people pixels than some of the real life people running around today  expand
2785,this game is phenomenal  it is one of the prettiest games i have ever played  and is such a fun time  it is a game about progression and improvement over time  it is so much fun to just pick up for 20 minutes and do the daily jobs  i like to watch all my villagers interact with the environment and each other  and learn more about them as characters 
2786,i have put about 250 hours in at this point and i still do not see a day coming where i wouldo not check my island  this is my first animal crossing game and so far in having a blast  starting out with a desolate nothing island and building it up to an metropolis has been the best thing while stuck at home 
2787,best game i have ever played with my special one  stop bombing the score  it is not fair 
2788,it is a great game that will give you hundreds and thousands of hours  the beginning feels slow  and your island feels lonely and empty  but little by little  you will start to fill it to the brand with furniture  plants  fences  it is pure positive feelings  do not look at the 0s  they are part of the usual review bombing
2789,extremely polished  but still have some things to improve  specially on the quality of life suction related crafting and terraforming
2790,el mejor animal crossing que han hecho hasta ahora  con multitud de posibilidades y con contenido nuevo durante 3 años  por lo menos 
2791,if you people score the game a zero or a one out of ten on a tiny inconvenience that decidedly does not harm the overall experience unless you wouldo not read up on what you need to do  you need to get over yourself  i have issues with the game  yes  but none of them are worth metabombing the game over  and if you think it is  the game s not for you 
2792,good and fun game  only thing stopping me from giving it a 10 is nothe 1 island per console limitation 
2793,this game is incredible  it is has so many improvements from previous animal crossing game and is an overall fun and charming experience  it is a lot of fun visiting friends islands and playing online with others  the game provides a hole new level of customization  with the ability to create new higher land  waterfalls  rivers and more  you can also customize many pieces of furniture andthis game is incredible  it is has so many improvements from previous animal crossing game and is an overall fun and charming experience  it is a lot of fun visiting friends islands and playing online with others  the game provides a hole new level of customization  with the ability to create new higher land  waterfalls  rivers and more  you can also customize many pieces of furniture and place furniture outside  all this allows you to really make the island how you want  definitely a must have for anyone on the switch  expand
2794,animal crossing siempre ha sido una gran saga y aunque el juego se sentía vacío  en la última actualización se quita esa sensación ya que meten las obras de arte
2795,i absolutely love this game  it is such a good distraction from what is going on in the world right now  the instant serotonin i get from new horizons is a dependable joy every day  all of the negative reviews i have read do not seem to understand how the game fundamentally works  it is almost only a single player game  and you can link up with friends and visit each others  islands  so maybei absolutely love this game  it is such a good distraction from what is going on in the world right now  the instant serotonin i get from new horizons is a dependable joy every day  all of the negative reviews i have read do not seem to understand how the game fundamentally works  it is almost only a single player game  and you can link up with friends and visit each others  islands  so maybe do not buy it if you are only looking for a game your entire family can play at once on one console  but do buy it if you are missing your friends  this is a great way to still hang out while socially distancing  expand
2796,do not listen to the crybaby troll reviewers complaining about the game and giving it a nonsensical 0 point score just because they re too broke to buy another switch for a second island   newsflash   the switch was always intended to be a personal  one to one device like a smartphone   not intended to service many different people in the same household like a traditional  non mobile homedo not listen to the crybaby troll reviewers complaining about the game and giving it a nonsensical 0 point score just because they re too broke to buy another switch for a second island   newsflash   the switch was always intended to be a personal  one to one device like a smartphone   not intended to service many different people in the same household like a traditional  non mobile home console  although nintendo has graciously accommodated some multi user elements like having multiple user accounts on a single switch   but they re not obligated to design games that way   do not like it   too bad   take your broke self to the store and buy another one   oh  and the game is a delight   it does not need a narrative or an overarching sense of goals   it was always intended to be a chill life sim and is absolutely sublime to play  expand
2797,one island per console sucks  but you know what does not suck  the literal rest of the game  stop review bombing this game  you babies 
2798, first of all just because there is a feature missing  that s not a reason to give a game a flat out 0  animal crossing new horizons is fantastic  as a new player to the series i was very pleasantly surprised and have found myself playing the game everyday since launch especially due to the quarantine  with the base game content alone i probably would give the game an 8  but due to the first of all just because there is a feature missing  that s not a reason to give a game a flat out 0  animal crossing new horizons is fantastic  as a new player to the series i was very pleasantly surprised and have found myself playing the game everyday since launch especially due to the quarantine  with the base game content alone i probably would give the game an 8  but due to the fact that they will be continuing to add content for the next 3 years at least  i have to give the game a 9  and very close to a 10  expand
2799,great game and great time killer  all these soyboys making fake reviews need a life  funny how you mfs have one one review in your profiles 
2800,the fact that it is getting review bombed speaks upon how absolutely amazing this game is  y all truly hate to see it winning 
2801,i would have given the game an 8 except nintendo thinks they re being slick by limiting one island per console   i bought the game for my son and i cannot advance the game because only the first person to play the game can propel the island level forward   my son is prone to taking anything i leave outside my house  i can only imagine how that would go down with multiple kids playing oni would have given the game an 8 except nintendo thinks they re being slick by limiting one island per console   i bought the game for my son and i cannot advance the game because only the first person to play the game can propel the island level forward   my son is prone to taking anything i leave outside my house  i can only imagine how that would go down with multiple kids playing on the same system  expand
2802,one island per console is so ridiculous  i bought the game for my two children to play  so unhappy with how it plays where one basically can change the island and the other is stranded and forced to watch on  would never have bought it if i would read these reviews first  buyer beware 
2803,shame on you nintendo  granted  i wouldid not realize research had to be done ahead of purchasing the game to find out that two switches would be required to play the game with my fiance  one island per switch  the menu and loading systems are clunky and frustrating  waste of 100  shame  i really wanted to enjoy this 
2804,game is sort of fun if you wouldo not plan on sharing  one island per console is ridiculous  goals get old and seem mundane  other than making your house bigger and earning money  there is no clear direction  seems exactly like all other ac games that came before  no real improvements or anything game changing

2807,very bad  just one island per nintendo switch  very sad and unnessary  fix it with a simple update 
2808,bought to share with a housemate  only to later find out that only one player per console can experience the full game  does not matter if you switch profiles  you can only join the first players island  an absolute joke for those wanting their own experience  which is what this game is about  a blatant move from nintendo to sell more switches otherwise forcing you to decide which onebought to share with a housemate  only to later find out that only one player per console can experience the full game  does not matter if you switch profiles  you can only join the first players island  an absolute joke for those wanting their own experience  which is what this game is about  a blatant move from nintendo to sell more switches otherwise forcing you to decide which one person gets to enjoy the full game  so much for a family friendly console eh  would never have bought this if i had known beforehand  expand
2809,the limitation to one island per switch breaks completely the game if there is more than one player  the second player is notoo limited and will not enjoy the game in most cases 
2810,sorry  i just cannot seem to like this game  i just cannot find the craze everyone else is finding  i played it for 1 2 hours  and have not found anything  major  i wouldo not get why people like this game  it is incredibly slow paced

2812,i am really dissapointed with this game   in my house im with my little cousin and my sister  and one island per console  the only way to get another is noto buy another console i wouldo not mind buying another copy of the game but another console is notoo much  i am leaving such a negative score in the hopes nintendo has a change of heart   
2813,hated can only have one island  if you have brothers and sisters want to have their own islands  it is not allowed  you need to buy a different switch 
2814,total waste of money  u can only get so far each day and u have to actually wait real time until morning  oh and if u time travel u earn less interest  better to not play it than to suffer by yourself
2815,the game is fun and relaxing but the one island per console set up is going to cause me a divorce  i played the game first without realizing my wife would be a completely second class citizen on my island   basically all the decisions get made by me and she cannot participate in the story at all  really upsetting  it is a great game but honestly if two people in your family want to play itthe game is fun and relaxing but the one island per console set up is going to cause me a divorce  i played the game first without realizing my wife would be a completely second class citizen on my island   basically all the decisions get made by me and she cannot participate in the story at all  really upsetting  it is a great game but honestly if two people in your family want to play it it is not worth it  expand
2816,when cloud saves are added this will turn into a 10 if my switch breaks everything is gone and that is garbage
2817,yea  yea  i know  please read fully  i promise not to be the typical bad review  though  i have the rating so low for the same reasons  i have always seen nintendo as a family connecting platform  some of my fondest memories are playing mario kart  super smash  and wii sports on the wii  my sister got a switch for her birthday and i never really thought much of it  but when new horizonsyea  yea  i know  please read fully  i promise not to be the typical bad review  though  i have the rating so low for the same reasons  i have always seen nintendo as a family connecting platform  some of my fondest memories are playing mario kart  super smash  and wii sports on the wii  my sister got a switch for her birthday and i never really thought much of it  but when new horizons released she was eager to let me jump in  i have never played animal crossing  but this was outstandingly a great experience  i fell in love  but i struggled to help her build homes  and was not treated the same  nor did i interact with importance with tom  i felt discriminated against  i soon learned why  with the one island per console  and the founder having all the decision making  really  really  really sucked  i would have loved to then start my own island  or co run the one we were in  i could not choose where buildings went  i could not progress  and i could not even invite villagers  one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the entire game  i was stuck  and worst of all  this literally damaged my relationship with my sister  i am twice her age and i felt we finally found a way to bond  but no  nintendo turned from a family connecting idea  to a family tearing nightmare  i absolutely hate it  and i cannot play it anymore  and that has led my sister to stop  and now i feel guilty  and everything is absolutely terrible  how could a overly family friendly game turn into a despair enducing experience  however  it is still a 4 because if you were solo this game is absolutely perfect  but this game is built around socializing and family  and it decided it wanted to ruin both  if you want to play with anymore then a single person  which is what was frost attractive about the game  then do not buy nintendo  please  i beg you to rethink your decision  make multiple islands where others can found  or make a co founder system where both share absolutely the same privileges love this game  but hate it too  expand
2818,i have enjoyed my time with new horizons a ton i loved how they improved on customization and things of the sort but there is many sore thumbs that stick out to me being a long time fan  one is how any other accounts on the switch are forced to share a island now this isn t a big problem for me as i am the only one who plays but it is a big problem in terms of progressing as you cannot help outi have enjoyed my time with new horizons a ton i loved how they improved on customization and things of the sort but there is many sore thumbs that stick out to me being a long time fan  one is how any other accounts on the switch are forced to share a island now this isn t a big problem for me as i am the only one who plays but it is a big problem in terms of progressing as you cannot help out to expand the island  only the first person can causing a lot of hassle  so the rating loses a point from that  then secondly it feels like most of the loved furniture sets are not even in the game and with that it feels empty along with multiple npcs missing it just makes me feel like a this game was rushed even though in reality it was worked on for a long time  it feels bad to be harsh like this but there is just a couple of big negatives that pushed the score down for me  expand
2819,es muy buen juego   muy relajante y bonito  con buena música y gráficos preciosos

2825,do not believe the haters this is a great game band me and my partner are having a great time on our shared island nearly 200 hours in
2826,this game has presented an interesting escape out from quarantine while giving a sense of accomplishment on short daily gameplays 
2827,this is a great game  not the best i have ever played but for what it is  a simulation game  it is a good game
2828,great game to play but one island per switch isn t good multiplayer feature  maybe nintendo can patch this later on  with that said if your a animal crossing fan you will still love this game 
2829,this is by far the greatest game in the series  it adds many things to keep you busy everyday  and even after over a month of game play it has yet to become boring to me  the game continues to bring fun surprises and charming dialogue  at least 95  of the negative reviews are due to the unfortunate limitation of 1 island per console  despite this restriction this game is still outstandingthis is by far the greatest game in the series  it adds many things to keep you busy everyday  and even after over a month of game play it has yet to become boring to me  the game continues to bring fun surprises and charming dialogue  at least 95  of the negative reviews are due to the unfortunate limitation of 1 island per console  despite this restriction this game is still outstanding and the spam of zeros are simply childish  yes  it is unfortunate that nintendo places many arbitrary restrictions on their games but overall the quality is outstanding  i would recommend this game to anyone  especially if you use games to relieve stress  expand
2830,the one island per console is pretty stupid  but i really enjoy the game  probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same switch but for me it is not too much of a problem  really great way to unwind  the nook miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now  kinda wish it was not locked to real time but mostly because i am impatient  i canthe one island per console is pretty stupid  but i really enjoy the game  probably a much bigger issue for those with families or multiple users on the same switch but for me it is not too much of a problem  really great way to unwind  the nook miles are a little gimmicky but keep the game interesting for now  kinda wish it was not locked to real time but mostly because i am impatient  i can see myself logging a metric f ton of time into this game  good way to calm down after ripping and tearing through hell in doom eternal  expand
2831,first things first  the one island per console thing is nothing new for the series  and isn t really a problem imo  the problem is nothe lack of progression for the players outside of  the citizen representative  with that out of the way  i can get to gushing  this game is absolutely gorgeous  and all the additions feel like a true step forward for the series  the ability to place furniturefirst things first  the one island per console thing is nothing new for the series  and isn t really a problem imo  the problem is nothe lack of progression for the players outside of  the citizen representative  with that out of the way  i can get to gushing  this game is absolutely gorgeous  and all the additions feel like a true step forward for the series  the ability to place furniture outside is huge  and all the creativity that results from terraforming has basically resulted in an animal crossing renaissance  the same switch co op is cool and a nice addition  but isn t something you will use much outside of the first few days   the game does fall short in a couple areas  an  initial  lack of content  a lack of online modes like tortimer club  and a very slow start this game feels like if the series skipped new leaf and built off of city folk  but kept the characters from new leaf  expand
2832,best animal crossing game in the series  have played all since the gamecube  new horizons builds on the foundations of new leaf and makes it into an experience that lets you customise your world and play the game how you want to play it  lots more to keep you engaged than previous games  overall a great experience
2833,i wish that you could island design like you wouldesign your room  other than that the game is actually really good and i cannot wait till the next updates 
2834,great game with some issues like 1 island per switch but i wouldont really care about that since im the only one on my switch
2835,i never played the other animal crossing games  but this one blew me out of the water  all those bad reviews are not right  if you just want to relax for a couple of hours you should buy this game 
2836,extraordinary  its truly a must have switch titlle  i always get excited every mroning when i wake up to discover and explore the world of new horizons   10 10
2837,this game has recently gotten review bombed so ill just say this  even if your the second account on a switch you still get to experience 90  of the game  true there are some parts at the beginning but i would not say they were anything special  this game is helping a lot of people out right now with current events and is a very fun and calming experience for all ages  people review bombingthis game has recently gotten review bombed so ill just say this  even if your the second account on a switch you still get to experience 90  of the game  true there are some parts at the beginning but i would not say they were anything special  this game is helping a lot of people out right now with current events and is a very fun and calming experience for all ages  people review bombing are selfish and immature  if you have not reviewed this game yet and you enjoyed the game please write a positive review to counteract the review bombing  expand
2838,animal crossing  new horizons offers a relaxing time  with a lot of cute animals with different personalities and amazingly fun gameplay you get to choose your very own island  where you can do whatever you want with it  you can build  decorate  fish  catch insects  dig up fossils  craft and much more while the game offers extremely fun gameplay  a great soundtrack  and a real timeanimal crossing  new horizons offers a relaxing time  with a lot of cute animals with different personalities and amazingly fun gameplay you get to choose your very own island  where you can do whatever you want with it  you can build  decorate  fish  catch insects  dig up fossils  craft and much more while the game offers extremely fun gameplay  a great soundtrack  and a real time system  the multiplayer part of the game is quite a disappointment while the multiplayer part of the game is nothe only disappointment of the game  since what players can do on other players islands are very limited  by playing it alone  multiplayer will not really ruin the game experience  because of the games so fun gameplay elements with a relaxing soundtrack  and fun gameplay and a interesting real time system  animal crossing  new horizons is a remarkable game  expand
2839,i love the game i picked it up on march 20th and have not been able put it down
2840,amazing animal crossing game  much more customization than before as well as crafting and technical improvements make it the best one in my opinion 
2841,i really thought i would hate this game when i got it  a friend of mine kept recommending it and i cracked  i wouldid not even boot it up for the first two days  then i started playing and wooow  i love the experience  i have clocked 160 hours so far and while there are a few qol changes i would recommend  i honestly love it  i am so addicted  it is so relaxing and so much fun i am a solo playeri really thought i would hate this game when i got it  a friend of mine kept recommending it and i cracked  i wouldid not even boot it up for the first two days  then i started playing and wooow  i love the experience  i have clocked 160 hours so far and while there are a few qol changes i would recommend  i honestly love it  i am so addicted  it is so relaxing and so much fun i am a solo player though  so i wouldo not have the issues the others have  expand
2842,honestly only a few tedious things keep this game from a higher rating  it mostly just has to with not being able to craft multiple things at once  this would not be an issue if it was not such a big part of the game  that being said it is an amazing game and a must buy for switch 
2843,the physical edition is hard to find because everyone is buying it  thanks a lot xbox10 10
2844,love this game  very smooth a lot of fun stuff to do and all round a great  game  the cloud save issue is enough to not make it a 10 10 but it hardly effects my opinion  if you like chill gaming then definitely get this game 
2845,so much fun  i have played most of the animal crossing games and enjoyed them all  but this feels like the pinnacle of the series  so much to do  so many options  and the ability to play however you want  a very cute game that brings all the joy of what we expect from animal crossing plus a whole lot more 
2846,fantastic game to chill to  and perfect for our current worldwide situation  people are complaining about a lack of cloud saves  and their complaints are warranted  but i wouldo not think it warrants such negative scores  the game is nothe best the series has ever been  and with a constantly changing game like this vs its predecessors makes for a more long lasting game  the ability to change thefantastic game to chill to  and perfect for our current worldwide situation  people are complaining about a lack of cloud saves  and their complaints are warranted  but i wouldo not think it warrants such negative scores  the game is nothe best the series has ever been  and with a constantly changing game like this vs its predecessors makes for a more long lasting game  the ability to change the landscape at a whim  the ability to jump over to someone else s island with ease  and the crafting system makes this nothe most intricate animal crossing released  is it a perfect game  no  but it is definitely better than the current user ratings let on  expand
2847,great game  the review bombing is not a fair assessment of the quality of this game
2848,this game is fantastic  i have had a lot of fun playing it  it creates very joyful world for you to explore and develop  only downside is nothe multiplayer  i know a lot of players were mad being limited to one island per switch console  but i am actually happy they made it this way  now i can develop my island with the help of my siblings  however  playing at the same time sucks  one player isthis game is fantastic  i have had a lot of fun playing it  it creates very joyful world for you to explore and develop  only downside is nothe multiplayer  i know a lot of players were mad being limited to one island per switch console  but i am actually happy they made it this way  now i can develop my island with the help of my siblings  however  playing at the same time sucks  one player is nothe leader which the other players have to follow  i would greatly prefer split iscreen to this  great to play solo though  expand
2849,the game looks amazing and relaxing  you can do many creative things with it  i really enjoyed the game  but the one island per switch and no backup data sucks  initially  i thought to rate it 8 or 9 but these things can be easily fixed with an update  other than that it is an awesome game 
2850,man what is nothere not to like about this game  i literally cannot put the thing down  i would give it a 10 if it were not for the limitations on the switch when it comes to save file transferring and one island per console  but as far as the game itself nintendo struck a home run 
2851,los of unassuming relaxed fun  perfect for quarantine season  the visuals are also very cute  and it is obviously very kids friendly
2852,i love this game  you can spend hours doing relaxing things  decorating your house and island  it is about all i play anymore lol
2853,awesome and beautiful game  some of the dialog cannotake a bit to get through  but that s nothing new from the game series  i think with a couple easy quality of life fixes  this game could be perfect 
2854,this game is great for people who need a getaway or just need to be in their own world  there are a few gripes  1  you can only have one island per console  2  you have to wait a day before the airport opens  and 3  you cannot access the majority of the island when you start and end up having to wait even longer  other than that  this game has helped me through the covid 19 pandemic  it isthis game is great for people who need a getaway or just need to be in their own world  there are a few gripes  1  you can only have one island per console  2  you have to wait a day before the airport opens  and 3  you cannot access the majority of the island when you start and end up having to wait even longer  other than that  this game has helped me through the covid 19 pandemic  it is given me a world where i can do what i want and make friends along the way  i can create my own neighborhood and get creative with it  this game is definitely worth the  60 price tag and you should pick it up as soon as possible  expand
2855,animal crossing is a well designed relaxing game  i have been a fan of the series for a while and find this new entry to be the best yet  the game is extremely well polished with the graphics being quite nice and no bugs that i have seen and the gameplay is immensely fun even if the game did start off quite slow to get into thingsit did release with a few features from previous gamesanimal crossing is a well designed relaxing game  i have been a fan of the series for a while and find this new entry to be the best yet  the game is extremely well polished with the graphics being quite nice and no bugs that i have seen and the gameplay is immensely fun even if the game did start off quite slow to get into thingsit did release with a few features from previous games lacking  but nintendo are showing they re adding in new content regularly and most of what i was missing is being added in  the issue people have with player 1 being in control and everyone locked behind their progression is a genuine concern but is being taken to an extreme level by people  no it is not a 1 10 game  expand
2856,excelente juego para relajarte y disfrutar de la isla y lo que propone  muy recomendable
2857,the game keeps getting better with the updates  and is set to be the best in the series whilst keeping to the core aim of the game   this being to promote co operation with players and build a sense of community around the development of a small village   if you cannot play well with others  this game isn t for you 
2858,its a great game  i enjoyed too much i play every day and its a pretty nice game
2859,dont listen to the idiots it is a reallly good game i couldnt care about one island limit because i am not a sad pathetic weirdo who is looking at anything they cannoto pick at the game if you got through your original save to fast shouldnt of time skipped you fool okay play it and see for yourself i really like it
2860,just here to contradict the unfair zero s  i wouldo not own the game so pay no mind to me 
2861,i had to change my 9 10 rating to a 10 10 to try and counter balance all the dumb poeple bombing the critics  this is exactly why user critics do not matter  because of salty users 
2862,honestly  the game itself is hidden behind problems like micromanaging and nerfs  the idea that a game like this needs to be controlled to such an extent is really silly imo  nerfing various spawns in the game by 90  forcing absolutely terrible events that actually impede a person s ability to play   substituting pretty much every findable item for eggs that spawn at a ridiculous ratehonestly  the game itself is hidden behind problems like micromanaging and nerfs  the idea that a game like this needs to be controlled to such an extent is really silly imo  nerfing various spawns in the game by 90  forcing absolutely terrible events that actually impede a person s ability to play   substituting pretty much every findable item for eggs that spawn at a ridiculous rate  think higher than 50  frequently honestly i could go on  the base game is alright  everything that they have attached to it is a cancerous growth that has ruined the host game plusthe fact that i would have to buy a completely new switch and game to be able to share the game the people i live with is completely unacceptable  expand
2863,the fact that you can only have one island per switch is notruly   ridiculous 
2864,buyer beware  only one person is allowed to play this game per console  seriously  you can have other people make accounts and visit the island but only one person may go on with the story this was a combined easter present for my 3 kids  shame on me for not doing more research but we have never had a problem with other nintendo titles  in this way  in the past nintendo  we arebuyer beware  only one person is allowed to play this game per console  seriously  you can have other people make accounts and visit the island but only one person may go on with the story this was a combined easter present for my 3 kids  shame on me for not doing more research but we have never had a problem with other nintendo titles  in this way  in the past nintendo  we are big supporters of you  i have played your games and bought your consoles for most of my 34 years on this earth  open up the game for my family  this game is simply not worth it as it istands  expand
2865,i just created an account to rate this badly in hopes of preventing somebody else from buying this game without the knowledge that only one island per console is allowed  wth nintendo  i wanted to play some days after watching my wife play  it turns out that 1  i cannot create my own island2  i am not the owner of the island 3  if i buy another console for my wife  i cannot transfer thei just created an account to rate this badly in hopes of preventing somebody else from buying this game without the knowledge that only one island per console is allowed  wth nintendo  i wanted to play some days after watching my wife play  it turns out that 1  i cannot create my own island2  i am not the owner of the island 3  if i buy another console for my wife  i cannot transfer the game data to the other console  at least not right now  if you want to play this game  please do some research before doing so as it might not work out for you  expand
2866,1 island for 1 switch  just 1 real payer per family  it is realy bad by nintendo
2867,only one island per console  such a ridiculous limitation to add  the first person to play the game on your console is permanently in charge of the island  feels like i got cheated 
2868,i am changing my review from a 5 10 to a 9 10 simply because i was too ignorant to give the game more of a chance and now that i have i am genuinely enjoying the it 
2869,do not buy animal crossing unless you live alone  or no one else wants to play the game nintendo crippled it  so that only one person gets to do anything fun at all  one island per switch  meaning everyone who s not the primary player is stuck with literally nothing to do i can only imagine how this must go in homes with multiple children  it must result in a lot of crying and fights do not buy animal crossing unless you live alone  or no one else wants to play the game nintendo crippled it  so that only one person gets to do anything fun at all  one island per switch  meaning everyone who s not the primary player is stuck with literally nothing to do i can only imagine how this must go in homes with multiple children  it must result in a lot of crying and fights  nintendo  you are a bunch of jerks  expand
2870,my son started the game in the first place  however he lost interest in the game  i have more than 50 hours of play  i will have to start all over again for when an update so we can change the representative resident nintendo 
2871,you cannot build two different island on the same console also with two different account and this is very bad  just 6 for this game
2872,a great game ruined by nintendos lack of polish online is incredibly cumbersome  there is no way to back up saves  you can only have 1 island per switch screwing other people in your household  and crafting was very poorly done  requiring you to craft one thing at a time with no way to improve that tool durability is also just completely anti fun 
2873,i personally enjoyed this game but it is most likely because i wouldo not have to share my switch with anyone   it must be so frustrating having to share a switch with a sibling or your significant other because player 2 will just not be able to enjoy the game like player 1  it was annoying when you had to buy another cartridge to have your own town in the past games but now you cannot even doi personally enjoyed this game but it is most likely because i wouldo not have to share my switch with anyone   it must be so frustrating having to share a switch with a sibling or your significant other because player 2 will just not be able to enjoy the game like player 1  it was annoying when you had to buy another cartridge to have your own town in the past games but now you cannot even do that  no  because nintendo is money hungry and wants to suck every last penny from your wallet for no   reasons  now you have to buy a whole new switch which is 300  instead of 60 40  like before this is just disgusting  i really hope nintendo will fix this  expand
2874,cuando era más niño me encantaba la saga  respeto que a mucha gente le guste y también que la prensa y los fans lo valoren  pero lo veo sobrevalorado más de la cuenta  ahora lo veo con otros ojos o mis gustos cambiaron  con los marios me acabó pasando lo mismo   son más de lo mismo pero con mejores gráficos 
2875,anything other the first player does not get to play the full game and will not ever progress  either the other players should have the same privilages as the first player  or remove the arbitary one island per consol soft limit

2883,we are in the middle of a lockdown and family s will want to play  and yet only one person gets to experience the full game  honestly  i would not suggest that anyone buys the game until this is changed due to the lack of care for the customers  any other console would not force the users to purchase another one just so multiple people can play individually  this generation of animal crossingwe are in the middle of a lockdown and family s will want to play  and yet only one person gets to experience the full game  honestly  i would not suggest that anyone buys the game until this is changed due to the lack of care for the customers  any other console would not force the users to purchase another one just so multiple people can play individually  this generation of animal crossing has really disappointed me  expand

2892,very disappointed by the fact only one person can get the full game experience  bought this for my girlfriend only to find out later that i am unable to do any of the activities her character is able to  i can only imagine the poor family that bought this for their two or more children only to find out that 1 of them will get a much better experience than the others  that ll be a funvery disappointed by the fact only one person can get the full game experience  bought this for my girlfriend only to find out later that i am unable to do any of the activities her character is able to  i can only imagine the poor family that bought this for their two or more children only to find out that 1 of them will get a much better experience than the others  that ll be a fun household to be in for a few days   whether this is a terrible design decision  a terrible profit motivated decision  or a terrible underestimation of how people like to share their experiences  it is  well  terrible   incidentally  if you asked my girlfriend  i am guessing she d rate it a lot higher  know why  she s allowed to get the full experience  turns out if you only let people play half the game  they only like it half as much  expand
2893,i am extremely disappointed that a family shared system would limit the amount of islands to a console  cheers  i have lost interest  it will not be in my household 
2894,nintendo needs to learn that they should allow their players the play the way you want  you know like the switches slogan  to play their games  with the recent patches and with the one island policy the person makes the second player or the third player have a worse experience  with the previous installments  it was fine but there are major flaws with the current system  you lose so muchnintendo needs to learn that they should allow their players the play the way you want  you know like the switches slogan  to play their games  with the recent patches and with the one island policy the person makes the second player or the third player have a worse experience  with the previous installments  it was fine but there are major flaws with the current system  you lose so much of the experience is nothe second player and are restricted in terms of progress if the first player does not play the game  i was actually sorry for my sister when i found out she could not do so much of what made the game fun  also  the game got a patch to reduce the interest rate and reduce the spawn rate of rare bugs  they are patching the game to make you play the way they want you to play  but  in turn  the game is less fun in my opinion  there ishould be more quality of life updates rather than them taking away stuff like this because it is so fun to just do what you want and the mundane task of cutting wood is only made worse than the slow crafting system and many inconveniences in the game  expand
2895,i recently got the game as a gift and i am actually loving it  incredibly fun and addictive  i only have a switch lite so i am not impacted by the 1 switch  1 island problem regardless  i cannot give a good review to a game which is so clearly anti consumer  nintendo used to be one of the last few holdouts standing against the despicable practices ruining the gaming industry  but now iti recently got the game as a gift and i am actually loving it  incredibly fun and addictive  i only have a switch lite so i am not impacted by the 1 switch  1 island problem regardless  i cannot give a good review to a game which is so clearly anti consumer  nintendo used to be one of the last few holdouts standing against the despicable practices ruining the gaming industry  but now it iseems they are jumping onto the bandwagon in a thinly veiled attempt to sell more switches  why they need to do this when its selling like crazy is beyond me  hopefully  they will remove this ridiculous rule in an update and i can delete the second half of this review  expand

2897,this is my first ac so i cannot compare it to the previous ones  but i like this game a lot so far  i was not sure what was interesting about it before  but i know it now  i have been playing every day since i bought it  because i have to save bells and remake the whole island lol i am sure you would enjoy it more if you had a friend to play with  but i think you will enjoy it for the time being this is my first ac so i cannot compare it to the previous ones  but i like this game a lot so far  i was not sure what was interesting about it before  but i know it now  i have been playing every day since i bought it  because i have to save bells and remake the whole island lol i am sure you would enjoy it more if you had a friend to play with  but i think you will enjoy it for the time being  even on your own  expand
2898,i really like this game  but i think there is a lot of room for improvement i have played just about all of the ac titles at this point and this in my opinion is nothe second best  new leaf first there is a big lack of variety in dialogue with the villagers in the sense talking to them more than 2x per day gets them all mad and complain that the island is not big enough for the two ofi really like this game  but i think there is a lot of room for improvement i have played just about all of the ac titles at this point and this in my opinion is nothe second best  new leaf first there is a big lack of variety in dialogue with the villagers in the sense talking to them more than 2x per day gets them all mad and complain that the island is not big enough for the two of you not enough buildings  as of right now there are only 2 shops and all other npc s only visit once in awhile on unpredictable schedules what is nothe point of isabelle announcements at the start of each day if she s not going to tell me when i have visitors like sahara or celeste just to name a few  i have defintely missed days with them on my island simply because i wouldid not know they were here rugs sold from sahara cannot be placed outdoors  why bother buying these if they can only be placed in my house when they would go perfectly with the furniture i set up outside  big opportunity missed there buying clothing from the able sisters shop is so time consuming  especially if i am visiting someone else s island in the sense that i can only purchase one type of clothing at a time  ex buying the same shirt in multiple colors  i have to enter and exit the changing room several times  if there are other people waiting to use the single changing room available  it really slows everyone down the crafting   diy setup is really great  but i would like to be able to craft multiple items at a time and have my in home work bench connect to what s in storage in home  having all the materials in my pockets and trying to craft just takes up too much space  even with fully expanded inventory this seems like a long list of complaints  but the good really does outweigh the bad  expand
2899,i gave animal crossing at to try and balance out the review score  my real score is 7 10   disappointed with the game  it is kind of a boring game  not much to do for the most part and doing stuff feel s empty  i feel like it takes a very long time to get anything done  you get to the point were you have a large stack of crafting materials then half of what you would usually do is gone 
2900,es impresionante lo divertido que es  las horas se pasan volando  cada detalle es perfecto  para mí es el juego del año 
2901,es el mejor animal crossing de la historia y muy probablemente será juego del año  es una belleza

2903,most of the negative reviews are from people who did not understand what they were getting or did not give the game enough time to see how it ishapes up after some time yes  it is true you can only have one island per console  this has always been how animal crossing games work where multiple users share a town  it allows you to talk to the same npcs  contribute collectively to the museum most of the negative reviews are from people who did not understand what they were getting or did not give the game enough time to see how it ishapes up after some time yes  it is true you can only have one island per console  this has always been how animal crossing games work where multiple users share a town  it allows you to talk to the same npcs  contribute collectively to the museum  etc  so that you share the experience with your household  rather than having disparate experiences on different saves  it is how the game is supposed to be played  and i wouldare say it is better for it  my siblings and i shared a town in the original ac as a kid and one of the best parts was hiding items for others to find  talking about the villagers  and visiting each others  houses  none of this would be possible if each player had their own island on a single system it is also true that there are some things which only the first player can do  this feels arbitrary and actually is a bit of a bummer  i assume nintendo did this for narrative reasons  and so that adults playing with their kids would not have to live with their child s poor decisions or something like that  but as i said  it does feel a bit unnecessary and evokes more negative emotions than positive ones  so i wouldo not think this was a very smart design decision  still  the impact of these is actually pretty minimal in the grand scheme of the game  as becomes more apparent the longer you play  some people evidently did not play long enough and just posted their immediate gut reaction the slow pace of the game is not for everyone  but oddly most of the reviews here do not even touch on that  you should approach animal crossing a bit more like the sims than your typical game  that is  the goals are mainly to do basic life tasks  decorate  and talk to people  it is much more driven by self narrative  and your ability to enjoy it is going to depend on your own imagination and willingness to buy into the game world once you get past the initial cluelessness of wondering what you are supposed to be doing  you arealize there is a lot to do and the answer is whatever you feel like  fishing  catching bugs  collecting furniture  coordinating outfits  arranging trees  it is all part of the experience  but the game does not force you to do one particular thing  new horizons specifically adds some nice touches with the ability to place furniture outside  storage inside your house  etc  which are a sweet improvement over previous installments  and in a lot of ways make this nothe best animal crossing yet there are minor things i wish they did differently  for instance  i would like to mail things to friends before i visit their island  but i understand why that isn t an option   traditionally in ac games  you can only send letters to villagers after you have spoken with them directly  so they applied the same logic to real players  it would be nice if the shared screen co op allowed you to do things like travel together or open both players  inventories   the system in place has a leader and a follower  where the follower is restricted in what they can do  but you can switch who the leader is very quickly if need be  all of these things are rather petty in the grand scheme of things  though the game is fantastic and has a wide array of content  with evidence of much more on its way  we have already gotten a pretty beefy patch and a few events  so it iseems like nintendo is committed to regular updates at least for another year  given its popularity  you could see some of the complaints become irrelevant due to future updates  or they may just pack in a bunch more content  either way  the updates are really the cherry on top of a game that is easily one of the best of the year  do not listen to the complainers by the way  it is perfectly fine to play this game solo  too    reviews should not be so heavily weighted on the multiplayer experience only  expand
2904,i have had this game since launch and its been over a month now  its super fun and addictive  it has alot nostalgic value if you played new leaf or older  but i think its so much better  there are some many more things you can do to customize your island  they have a few new characters that are super cute  so far they have not added some of my favorites like brewster and katrina  but sincei have had this game since launch and its been over a month now  its super fun and addictive  it has alot nostalgic value if you played new leaf or older  but i think its so much better  there are some many more things you can do to customize your island  they have a few new characters that are super cute  so far they have not added some of my favorites like brewster and katrina  but since they added leif and redd in the last update  i believe they plan on adding the other missing npcs as time goes on  expand
2905,simply the best animal crossing to date  all the best features from the past animal crossings on nintendo s best console in decades  been playing it isince day one and i am still finding fun things to do  nintendo just keeps hitting it out of the park  my girlfriend loves it too  a must buy 
2906,this is nothe game we have been waiting for since new leaf and while it undoubtedly has problems that could be easily fixed  it is still the shiniest animal crossing game that we needed the game is beautiful  the water is s t u n n i n g  the attention to detail is amazing  it is everything game play is what you would expect of an animal crossing game  terraforming and crafting are intense this is nothe game we have been waiting for since new leaf and while it undoubtedly has problems that could be easily fixed  it is still the shiniest animal crossing game that we needed the game is beautiful  the water is s t u n n i n g  the attention to detail is amazing  it is everything game play is what you would expect of an animal crossing game  terraforming and crafting are intense  the control given to you literally makes you a god among animals it is a little concerning that there are a lot less features than what we had in base game new leaf  but the updates will happen and give us a lot more content  if you play this game the way it is intended to be played  it will not slow down  however  since we are all in corona time and going crazy  you might get tired nintendo has made some baffling choices that they re failing to fix that understandably can break this game for many  one island per console that is basically permanently tied to the console is a huge step back additionally  minor quality of life changes can also help tremendously  like bulk crafting  dropping multiple items at once  giving more pattern spaces  and cutting extra dialogue we have seen a hundred times  you have to press a on cj like 40 times each run in the fishing tourney  expand
2907,the game has a fantastic first two weeks that does a great job at constantly giving you new tasks that introduce new gameplay mechanics to the player  once you complete the  story  you are pretty much able to customize anything you want  resulting in the ability to make some pretty incredibly designed islands and homes the presentation is fantastic  the game s graphics are verythe game has a fantastic first two weeks that does a great job at constantly giving you new tasks that introduce new gameplay mechanics to the player  once you complete the  story  you are pretty much able to customize anything you want  resulting in the ability to make some pretty incredibly designed islands and homes the presentation is fantastic  the game s graphics are very stylized and the npcs are all very expressive  making the game feel like a real living world  the music is all very cute as well  especially the tracks by k k  slider you will eventually reach a point where the game becomes a lot less fun to play for extended periods of time  which is nothe norm for animal crossing  thankfully though  nintendo seems to be planning on supporting the game after launch and have already re introduced past features like the art museum and redd other than the eventual wall you hit where the game becomes less fun  the only really big flaws are some annoying menu management and crafting quirks  which will hopefully be patched  expand
2908,while the one island per console concept is lame  and i understand why people do not like it  i am the only user on my switch  nobody else plays it or even wants to  i will not judge a game based on a situation i am not in  i will however  judge a game based on my experience it is a fun game  very addicting  i have never been able to get into animal crossing until now  there is somethingwhile the one island per console concept is lame  and i understand why people do not like it  i am the only user on my switch  nobody else plays it or even wants to  i will not judge a game based on a situation i am not in  i will however  judge a game based on my experience it is a fun game  very addicting  i have never been able to get into animal crossing until now  there is something about turning an empty island into a bustling city that appeals to me  despite the overwhelming amount of games available to me at the moment  i have played animal crossing for at least 250 hours  which is not something i can say of many games you start off on an empty island in a tent and then work your way up to better housing through loans from the resident loan shark  with no interest  oddly enough  little by little you improve your island and your house and soon garner villagers to populate your village  you can pull weeds  catch bugs  fish  dig for fossils  design clothes  flags and a great many other things  it does get a bit repetitive  but is fun for me nonetheless  if you are the only person on your switch and you enjoy that kind of gameplay loop  this might be the game for you  expand
2909,el juego es maravilloso y que bien esta jugarlo en estos tiempos de cuarentena
2910,i am going to start this review by saying animal crossing new horizons is nothe best entry in the series  there is no doubt in my mind  the creativity and attention to detail that was put in by the developers is nothing short than inspiring  there is a part of me that is genuinely concerned for the future of the series  not for anything bad for the game  but for how much it has to offer i am going to start this review by saying animal crossing new horizons is nothe best entry in the series  there is no doubt in my mind  the creativity and attention to detail that was put in by the developers is nothing short than inspiring  there is a part of me that is genuinely concerned for the future of the series  not for anything bad for the game  but for how much it has to offer  where else cannothey go  the next installment is going to be something i am afraid of  they might not even come out with one and just update this gem of creativity  i am afraid i am not explaining enough  but what i amean is nothat from each iteration we gain a new customizable feature  from being from a standard town  then to a bigger place with friends being able to visit  then to an even bigger place that has a city element  to being a mayor able to change layouts and buildings and now to a god as the community jokes about being able to shift the land itself  hopefully  that explains my concern about the future of this game  where next  this definitely is  in my eyes  the ultimate animal crossing game and has provided millions of people including myself  hours upon hours of relaxing release  as i cross the 350 hour mark  i think its time for me to explain how i felt about the game  as the beginning is slow and may take a lot of time to start feeling like the traditional animal crossing everyone knows  you start understanding how the game is notrying to teach you the fundamentals of the new mechanics introduced  it can be frustrating at first if you are the impatient type  but it is well understood the more you play  that s what makes all these negative comments so surprising to read for me  i never have written a review to anything other than amazon products and maybe a youtube comment if you consider that a review of some sorts  i even made an account to just write about this notopic  yes  the game is limited to one island per person  do not go into this game expecting to have the experience of a maximum of 8 islands on your system  this is apparently is a reason for people to be giving the game a 0 on this site and others as well  not about the gameplay  or what a good bad game it is  or even how slow it takes to start as i thought the negative reviews would be about  no  it is about how f you have more than one account on your switch  the others will not be allowed to terraform the island  i cannot think of anyone who would od this other than children or people who are playing animal crossing for the first time  i wouldo not mean any of those remarks as insults  and i will explain  new leaf  the last game in the series before new horizons  one player was the mayor  and that s it  anyone else playing on your 3ds will not have access to those features  if the reasons for that are not apparent to you  then you wouldo not understand how basic computing and video games work and that s okay  it is okay to not understand something  that s why you should seek the information that you wouldo not understand  just think about how much memory it would take for the switch to have a maximum of 8 islands with all unique layouts  villagers  and all the other features that make this game the masterpiece that it is  that s not possible to fit on the system itself  therefore it is not a reality  it was not for the 3ds  so why is it a problem all a sudden  that s when kids come into the picture  parents will usually buy one system for the house and each kid wants to have their own island which i completely understand as i would as well as a child  however  does that inherently make it a bad game  of course not  i have another family member on my island who does not have terraforming access as they are the second player to move in  when they want to change something about the island they do one of the possible two things  they either ask me to change it for them  or they log in as me and do it themselves  oh yeah  did i amention the ability to switch accounts on the switch is minimalistically seamless  it takes less than 5 seconds to change profiles and start a game  it is fine to criticize a game  but it is downright insane to mass bad review a game for system limitations when the problem has nothing to do with the gameplay its self  if i am the wrong one for feeling this way then so be it  i ll stand alone  is nintendo just doing this noto sell more consoles  most definitely not  however  i wouldo not think they are complaining that this is an issue  then that gets into the problem of how the bad reviews may affect nintendo  but it hurts the animal crossing franchise more  people will see the negative source for consumers and assume it is just another game that critics love and the public did not  further greatening the divide between creators and fans  i really do not know what to say at this point other than how disappointing it is noto see the gaming culture turn into this immaturity and not appreciate the art that countless artists spent years creating  expand
2911,this is my first time playing animal crossing  and it is very addicting  very fun to play and there is always something to do  i understand why people are upset about the one island per console  but they should not give this game a low rating because of it  the graphics are amazing and the animations are cute  but something i hate is nothat the tools always break  it ruins the fun and i havethis is my first time playing animal crossing  and it is very addicting  very fun to play and there is always something to do  i understand why people are upset about the one island per console  but they should not give this game a low rating because of it  the graphics are amazing and the animations are cute  but something i hate is nothat the tools always break  it ruins the fun and i have to go build new tools which isn t relaxing at all  but overall  the game is amazing to play especially during this pandemic  it takes your mind off of things  if you are not sure whether or not to get this game  i was once in your shoes  and i bought the game because all of my friends had it  now i absolutely love the game  expand
2912,it is an adorable experience that constantly surprises  euphoric in the satisfaction it provides with each mechanic  no matter how big or small 
2913,doing my part to lower this game s score to say f4ck you to nintendo  i bought this as a game my wife would enjoy  and she likes it  but i cannot enjoy it too because some poopbutts at nintendo decided one island per switch was a good idea  you greedy s o bs
2914,had fun for the first few days  when my girlfriend wanted to start playing  we arealized that she could not have her own island  since neither of us wants to be player 2  which would severely limit what you can do  i lost all interest and will not play again until we can create separate islands on the same console 
2915,what s the point of a 2nd player if they cannot really contribute to building anything in the town  game is exactly what animal crossing is supposed to be i suppose but it gets pretty boring and repetitive  especially for anyone not the island representative  and for the rep since no one can actually help you build the town  boo  shame on nintendo until they make a patch for this
2916,base game is good  however you can only have one island per switch which is just a super greedy move  also the multiplayer is really slow and annoying  you cannot craft in bulk which is just boring  the game has a lot of flaws that make me want to bang my head into the wall already
2917,this is nothe most relaxing game on switch  the single player content is awesome  this is nothe place to meet new friends but why are people review bombing this game  i know that the one island per console is bad  but its not a reason to give this 0 10  they did it on purpose shame on you people 
2918,countering all the undeserved and blind hate   review bombing from the salty butthurt trolls  nintendo literally stated months before release that you only get one island per switch  the game isn t perfect  bit it isn t a 0 either  it is a great game  and greatly outweighs the setbacks of only one island the main people review bombing and giving this game a zero are the idiots with acountering all the undeserved and blind hate   review bombing from the salty butthurt trolls  nintendo literally stated months before release that you only get one island per switch  the game isn t perfect  bit it isn t a 0 either  it is a great game  and greatly outweighs the setbacks of only one island the main people review bombing and giving this game a zero are the idiots with a goldfish attention span who speed run   timeskip a literally casual game to try and beat it   if you honestly thought that going in  you wouldeserved to feel ripped off lmao  and the salty butthurt 10 iq mouth breathers who who bought the game without reading then wondering why there is only one switch file per system  again  they stated countless times that this game only has one save file per switch console  if you were stupid enough to ignore all of that and still buy the game  that s again  your fault for not having the capacity to read simple and basic disclaimers also  this game is getting updates as we speak  there is a good chance that such things will make it back in the game  also x2  whine all you want  the game sold extremely well and nintendo  nor true animal crossing fans like me who actually buy this game and enjoy playing it  are laughing at all the haters  stay salty  this game killed it in sales  and it is going to continue to kill it as one of the best games of the year long story short  if you want to play multiple save files  or cheat your way through the game  play new leaf  otherwise shut up  grow up  let people enjoy things  and deal with it  10 10  expand
2919,bought this game with my wife  only found out the island is shared between the switch after payment  this essentially kills both of our ability to play the game  this is a just a blatant money grab by nintendo  dont buy it 
2920,super annoyed and kinda angry  just purchased this game for  80 and found out multiple people cannot have their own island  only 1 island per switch not user   massive downfall of the game this needs to be fixed 
2921,i thought it was a great game and spent hours and hours building my island up to my specification  halfway through i have found there is a limit to my features needed to complete it  such as inclines and bridges  i am very angry and after spending so much time and effort to get to this point i honestly just want to put down the game and never play it again 
2922,it was fun when i started but it gets soooo boring catching bugs and fishes and then you get barely any money 
2923,yes the game is fun until you are blocked because you are the number 2 player on your switch and the first player do not have time to play and continue the story of the game  why could i not build bridges  buildings    just because i started to play later   if you share a switch  do not play this game  you can have fun for 1 2 wekks ubtil you are blocked and cannot do anything with theyes the game is fun until you are blocked because you are the number 2 player on your switch and the first player do not have time to play and continue the story of the game  why could i not build bridges  buildings    just because i started to play later   if you share a switch  do not play this game  you can have fun for 1 2 wekks ubtil you are blocked and cannot do anything with the island because you are not the first player  expand

2927,the one island limit is stupid  i cannot even play the game  because my brother has his own island  while i wouldo not  the only reason for this is noto get people to buy more nintendo switches  which may i amention cost about 500 dollars right now  which is ridiculous  this is something that bethesda or ea would do  but i never expected nintendo to do this  please fix this nintendo  i really wantthe one island limit is stupid  i cannot even play the game  because my brother has his own island  while i wouldo not  the only reason for this is noto get people to buy more nintendo switches  which may i amention cost about 500 dollars right now  which is ridiculous  this is something that bethesda or ea would do  but i never expected nintendo to do this  please fix this nintendo  i really want to enjoy this amazing in the fullest  without having to pay 500 dollars  expand
2928,one island per console for a whole family  this is a big shame for nintendo 
2929,the game is fun and i have enjoyed my time playing the game so far  however  not being able to transfer my island to a new switch is ludicrous  hacking will always be an issue and there is no need need to punish the fans for it  i can live with the cash grab of one island per switch but locking my island to one switch only is ridiculous 
2930,new horizons is so close to being an amazing game  but nintendo s shortcomings  oversight  or negligent understanding of the modern game environment means the game falls short  the game is pretty  polished  and cute  however it feels like a relic of the past  the major shortcoming of acnh is how the game plays when trying to play with friends  there is nothing to do with your friends  younew horizons is so close to being an amazing game  but nintendo s shortcomings  oversight  or negligent understanding of the modern game environment means the game falls short  the game is pretty  polished  and cute  however it feels like a relic of the past  the major shortcoming of acnh is how the game plays when trying to play with friends  there is nothing to do with your friends  you cannot build things together  you cannot paint together  decorate together  or even use basic terminal functions when someone is on your island  you cannot sell things on a friends island if you are playing too late at night  if someone tries to come to your island they will not be able to if you have a dialog box open  when a person comes everyone involved will have to wait through a lengthy loading screen  if anyone disconnects everyone s progress will be lost  these issues make no sense in today s video game landscape  no other large release has these problems  i want to love this game  it is beautiful  but the actual act of playing the game with my significant other  the reason i bought it  is near unbearable tedium  expand
2931,no family should have to buy multiple switches just for individuals to enjoy their own island and experience the full game  charge for multiple game copies  that is fine that is what ac has always done  save for memory cards on gamecube  the closest equivalent  but entire consoles  that is a shameful money grab 
2932,i have no issue when the developer decided to do this noto protect their product of being abused but when i look at the price tag of usd60 per copy i seriously think that they are trying to rip us off   i have 3 kids and i have to buy 3 copies of the game and 3 nintendo switches for them to play this game might as well i ask them to stick back to minecraft 
2933,only 1 island per switch console  not account  even if the game is purchased multiple times  only 1 island ambassador can make major decisions about the island  per switch console  not account  this leaves all other accounts on the console playing this game unable to progress the story  i hope nintendo does something to fix this  worst couch co op gameplay ever  it makes me sad that whatonly 1 island per switch console  not account  even if the game is purchased multiple times  only 1 island ambassador can make major decisions about the island  per switch console  not account  this leaves all other accounts on the console playing this game unable to progress the story  i hope nintendo does something to fix this  worst couch co op gameplay ever  it makes me sad that what would be a great game is hobbled by this poor choice in game design  expand
2934,unfortunately this game  like most nintendo games  falls under the umbrella of extreme nintendo fanboydom and as such is subject to insanely high biased reviews  not including the negative multiplayer ones basically if you ve ever played a game outside of the nintendo lineup say like minecraft  terraria  rimworld  stardew valley  subnautica  starbound  kenshi  etc etc etc  youunfortunately this game  like most nintendo games  falls under the umbrella of extreme nintendo fanboydom and as such is subject to insanely high biased reviews  not including the negative multiplayer ones basically if you ve ever played a game outside of the nintendo lineup say like minecraft  terraria  rimworld  stardew valley  subnautica  starbound  kenshi  etc etc etc  you quickly realize that there is almost nothing to animal crossing and certainly nothing making it worth paying full price for the world is extremely tiny  it is based on real time  which is cool on paper but terrible in practice  it is got 0 challenge  and it plays like a mobile game  in fact it looks just like it is mobile version pocket camp   you can run the entire starting area in about a minute  there are woefully limited resources across the entire island and woefully limited events or things to do across the entire game it is quite chill which can be a nice change of pace for about 10 to 20 minutes  but once you get past the bubbly exterior you quickly notice that there are no brains on the inside to keep you engaged and entertained  expand
2935,pretty good game with some limitations in single islands and locked out of progress multiple users which is a downer  and no cloud saves yet  great game otherwise 
2936,great game for people who want a calm game to relax to  i love this game it is great online play works well  it may not be for everyone only people who like slower pace games mostly because this game has full 24h days so you cannot sleep till the next day

2939,this game is notricky to rate   8 10 if you are the first player on your island and resident rep   but if you are not  then you are nothing more than a glorified npc   you cannot progress your island whatsoever and with only one island allowed per switch you have no possible way of actually playing the game 
2940,it is a complete disappointment that my partner  who has been playing these games for all of his life  had the first claim to an island and then i  who has never had the chance or interest to play any animal crossing game until now  will be unable to ever have the full game experience on the console that i had snagged from my friend for an unbeatable price  on top of the general principalit is a complete disappointment that my partner  who has been playing these games for all of his life  had the first claim to an island and then i  who has never had the chance or interest to play any animal crossing game until now  will be unable to ever have the full game experience on the console that i had snagged from my friend for an unbeatable price  on top of the general principal of me refusing to buy another system just for one game  the console is out of stock everywhere  and we do not live together so it is not like i can play anyway i have not seen him in almost two months  and i have to live away from my own home for a job  but even if i wouldid buy a new system i cannot even move my game to the console that i am already attached to after all of this is over  what a joke  i ll probably never play this and not have any desire to play an animal crossing ever because this restriction has just ruined any joy i could possible ever have for this series  expand
2941,the game is great  except for 1 thing  yo cannot have multiple islands per switch  me and my sister bought the game thinking we would be able to build our seperate islands individual paradise  but no  you cant even have 2 islands  and the worst part  as the second player you can berely contribute to the progress of the game  you fell like an npc more than a player  all  im asking is noto havethe game is great  except for 1 thing  yo cannot have multiple islands per switch  me and my sister bought the game thinking we would be able to build our seperate islands individual paradise  but no  you cant even have 2 islands  and the worst part  as the second player you can berely contribute to the progress of the game  you fell like an npc more than a player  all  im asking is noto have at least 2 islands per switch  or to be able to have more than 1 town organizer  expand

2943,one island per switch is a total joke  i could maybe understand one per user but it is ridiculous that this isn t made clear before purchase 
2944,the one island per console ruined this game for a family with kids  do not buy it until they fix it i literally created an account for this reason   greed of the company to try and sell more consoles is inexcusable

2949,one island per switch  gtfo  what an absolute joke  what moron thought that was a good idea 
2950,wow nintendo  this is a very greedy  move on your end to only have one island per user and console  i bought this game to play with my wife only to find out you could only have one island  this is not okay  you used to care about your fans and customers but now i am falling out of love with nintendo  i am not sure if i would ever buy another game because  60 is a lot of money to pay 
2951,the fact that only one person cannotruly experience the game in it is entirety is rediculous  it iseems like a money grab from nintendo to try and sell more consoles and that just isn t right 
2952,i amade an account just to say the one island per console is a terrible gimmick for more people to buy your product  at least with acnl you could buy another game to insert into the 3ds  this is absolute bs 
2953,i would return this  but i cant  i let my girlfriend play for a few hours  only to realize i could not make my own island after the fact  i want her to play it  but i bought it to enjoy myself  i guess i just cannot play it now  fun 
2954,i wanted to play this game  but because i share my switch with someone else  i cannot create my own save file  i can only build a house in their town and that s it  i thought that the whole point of this game was to create your own town  and that the point of having different accounts on your switch was so that everyone could create their own save file  it just does not make any sense to me 
2955, the complete review will be done later as someone who s gotten into animal crossing through pocket camp among other things  i enjoy playin  this game way more i wish the villagers had more personalities to set them apart from each other  considering there is still only 4 personalities for each gender  the only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to how they look the complete review will be done later as someone who s gotten into animal crossing through pocket camp among other things  i enjoy playin  this game way more i wish the villagers had more personalities to set them apart from each other  considering there is still only 4 personalities for each gender  the only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to how they look  not really what they say the reason i am mixed on this game an  maybe the series as a whole is nothat i wish there were more activities to do instead of the same fishin  bug catchin  shell collectin  fossil huntin  an  flower planting  with all these decorations in the game  you would think you could interact with more than a handful of  em in an interesting way  to shorten my review a bit  i think jim sterling sums it up pretty well in his jimpression of the game even though i wouldo not have anyone who i share my switch with that also plays the game  i can understand those who wanna have their own separate island between accounts an  it must be really frustrating to deal with i wouldo not like local multiplayer at all but online multiplayer is generally much better  i hate havin  to use nintendo switch online app since it is unnecessary to need an app for basic online stuff that sony an  microsoft have been doin  since they have built it into their systems  nintendo needs to stop being complacent with their terrible track record of trashy online service my biggest gripe with the game is nothere bein  no cloud save data for new horizons  making me fear the worst the more time into it  the game s director says it is to prevent cheating even though the game is mostly played solo  i heard splatoon s director sayin  somethin  similar to justify splatoon 2 s problems which were also pretty stupid  havin  no cloud saves is a massive double edge sword in that while it would prevent cheating  you could lose all that hard work due to some unforeseen reason which ll make me feel like i wouldid all that for nothin  in other words  it devalues the time i put into everything in the game in first place which is what the developers wanna promote  i understand the sentiment  but time travelin  is a thing albeit on a lesser scale  which i admittedly use from time to time  an  that ain t causin  a riot or at least it ishould not be  is cheating really that big of a problem in a game where you create your own experience  are you serious  it d be one thing if somethin  like this was runnin  rampant online in other games like mario kart 8 deluxe  but come on  if people rather stick to the legit way of playin  that s their decision  if people rather put their time into moddin  the game to speed up the progress  that s their decision  simple  whether they regret it in the long run is on them i like this franchise  but there is a lot of room for improvement  hopefully  some of the game s issues are patched  expand
2956,to be super honest without even considering the one character restriction  this game is overhyped  yes the atmosphere is relaxing and the graphics are cute  but this game for some reason does not really make me want to binge play it  maybe it was designed like that on purpose  with rocks and resources spawning daily once tapped  but overall  this isn t a game i would stay up playing  not toto be super honest without even considering the one character restriction  this game is overhyped  yes the atmosphere is relaxing and the graphics are cute  but this game for some reason does not really make me want to binge play it  maybe it was designed like that on purpose  with rocks and resources spawning daily once tapped  but overall  this isn t a game i would stay up playing  not to say it is bad or boring  just not so great in my eyes animal crossing new horizonsgameplay enjoyability  0   worst  10   best story   6lore   3character creation   5looting resource gathering   6questing variety   3side quests activities   6music soundtrack   9visuals   9  expand

2968,the game is great  but the fact that you can only have one island per switch is complete nonsense  very  very poor move and the reason i am writing this review 
2969,i really hope nintendo fixes the 1 island per switch  had high hopes of playing with my sister and friends online but this issue makes it unplayable
2970,the game feels tedious and does not feel like a aaa game  a lot of the mechanics are so monotonous  if you want to craft multiple items  you have to go through the menu every  single  time  to craft  so if you want to craft 10 hot items  you have to go through the process 10 times with so many button presses when they easily could ve let us craft a stack of items like minecraft  i wouldo notthe game feels tedious and does not feel like a aaa game  a lot of the mechanics are so monotonous  if you want to craft multiple items  you have to go through the menu every  single  time  to craft  so if you want to craft 10 hot items  you have to go through the process 10 times with so many button presses when they easily could ve let us craft a stack of items like minecraft  i wouldo not think the developers tested the game cuz if they did  they d realize how tedious and boring so many of the aspects are  also after you unlock terraforming  you can only break or build one thing at a time and the animation takes about two seconds per block  it took me half an hour to make some simple waterfalls and cliffs when it would have taken a fraction of the time if i wouldid not have to sit through the annoying animation for every block  they easily could ve made it iso we could break or build multiple things at once but like i said  it feels like the devs intentionally made the game super tedious cuz they thought it would be relaxing which it is not  it is annoying and they would realize if they played the game for more than 2 seconds  the villagers are also boring  in ac on the gamecube  the villagers had personality  felt different and wouldnt immediately treat you like a best friend  in this game  they all basically say the same stuff  they re all overly friendly and they no longer have chores for you in exchange for furniture  on top of that  they rarely interact with items or furniture which they do better in pocket camp  that s right  a  60 game has worse villagers than a free mobile game  also 1 island per switch is nothe worst move i have seen from nintendo in a long time and they should ve fixed it  i tried to get into this game but whenever i try to catch bugs  fish  build stuff or get bells  the enjoyment is quickly ruined by how boring and monotonous everything is  this game could be way better if they fixed a few things but guarantee they wont  expand
2971,it is unacceptable that nintendo made it iso second player literally gets almost no game  second player will not even have 1  of the privileges first player has  the worst thing is nothat nintendo will not do anything about it because they did it on purpose  to sell more consoles  i once again day    you nintendo for ruining the experience 
2972,so much potential for 1 person  do not get this game if you share  me and my wife got it  she is nothe island rep and barely plays so i have to account hop to progress the island  fix your game nintendo  either allow multiple people to be island reps  or add separate islands for each profile

2974,do not buy this game unless only you are going to play it  the so called primary player is literally the only player who has the privilege to contribute  i almost gave this game a 10 10 until i realized how messed up compared to the rest of the entire godddamn  series  this is because when you start by needingkm to give tom nook 5 bugs or fish do not buy this game unless only you are going to play it  the so called primary player is literally the only player who has the privilege to contribute  i almost gave this game a 10 10 until i realized how messed up compared to the rest of the entire godddamn  series  this is because when you start by needingkm to give tom nook 5 bugs or fish  only the primary player  which is my sister in my case  who plays the freaking least this game would get a 10 10 if there eren  expand
2975,alright  honestly speaking  this game is a good 7 8 10  the core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game  little improvements to the game  like actually having the option to move your home   being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome  the number of villagers possible to meet  and invite  is astounding  while not every villager makes aalright  honestly speaking  this game is a good 7 8 10  the core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game  little improvements to the game  like actually having the option to move your home   being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome  the number of villagers possible to meet  and invite  is astounding  while not every villager makes a comeback in the game  but a number of characters last seen in the original animal crossing finally make a return in this game after not appearing in earlier games i wouldo find fault with the one island per console thing  but  i think that has been overly addressed to the point where  my main issue with the game is nothe ui   camera layout listen  i am fine with not being able to rotate my camera outside of my house  it really isn t needed  what is needed  however  is nothe ability to look top down  way too many times have i amissed a glowing spot because they re hidden behind a building or something  it is great that you ve included it with the end of game mechanic  which isn t to be named for spoiler warnings  but i think it ishould become part of the core game mechanic the diy crafting menu sucks  and so does the inventory menu  let us say you are trying to craft items to sell because they make a ton of bells  sure  you can mash a to speed up the crafting process  but what if you wouldo not want to stress out the button you already spam for fishing  gotta fork up some money to buy a controller with turbo  or something  i would much rather have the option to craft multiple items at once  speaking of multiple items at once  it also would not hurt to change how people divide stacks in your inventory  you need to select the item  and select grab one in order to move separate something from a stack  but only at one at a time  it d be great if we could indicate how many we would like to separate from said stack to save on time  also worth mentioning  but i wouldo not think the game s worth  60  i wouldo not have a reasoning behind this  but  i think  50 might be a more appropriate price with all of that said  i am not dropping the game  i love it and will keep playing it  it isucks that my little sister cannot play the game too  but since i am playing this single player  i am fine with this  hopefully  they can repatch the game to support multiple players in the near future tl dr pros  similar enough to older games  able to finally move your home  so many villagers to meet  some returning for the first time in a while mixed  crafting is cool but kinda tedious cons  camera angels are kinda annoying to hold  one profile per console  controversial opinion  but i wouldo not think it is worth  60 verdict  honestly a 7 5 10  but i ll give it an 8  expand
2976,this may not be the most complex game  but something about it is undeniably charming and addictive  the little animal villagers are extremely adorable and its very wholesome building friendships with them there are some problems with the game that are complete dealbreakers for people though  like only having one game per console  luckily that does not really affect me  or i would havethis may not be the most complex game  but something about it is undeniably charming and addictive  the little animal villagers are extremely adorable and its very wholesome building friendships with them there are some problems with the game that are complete dealbreakers for people though  like only having one game per console  luckily that does not really affect me  or i would have had a real problem with this game  it would also be good if you could play couch co op with full functionality for the second player  the second player cannot really do much  there are also some problems that should be fixed such as being able to craft multiple things at once  i think there are also some kinks to be worked out with kicking villagers out  there are 3 villagers that i want out and i have not talked to them for a month  and they still will not leave  the only ones that ask to leave are ones that i actually like  so that s just been pretty annoying for me  i also feel like there are several things that could have been added that would have made the game more rewarding in my opinion  i wish there was some factor of skill points that show your fishing experience level  or your friendship level with a villager  this may be getting a little too complicated though  but it is just my preference  another thing is it is very rare that the villagers or tom nook actually asks you to complete any activities such as fetch this specific bug  or make this furniture  this feels like a completely missed opportunity to fulfill requests for the villagers   i know this is something that is a feature in the game  but for some reason in my experience this opportunity rarely ever pops up  i wouldo wish there were a more things to do in the vein of quests  but i think the seasonal events will keep things interesting for the foreseeable future it is easy for me to point out all of the faults i have with this game but it is hard to explain why i still love it despite all its faults  it has it is problems  and on paper isn t much to do  but there is just something about it  overall  it is a very slow burn but it is satisfying to see your island develop from nothing and to your own ideal island aesthetic and friendships  the game has it is problems  but it is easy to overlook them because of how charming and addictive it is before i go  i have to shoutout my favorite villagers  apple and merengue  they re adorable and perfect and i would die for them  expand
2977,one of the best experiences i had on the switchit is calm and relaxing but is also very interesting  there is a lot to do in this game the graphics are amazing and playing this game is just a wonderful experience  people are giving this game a 1 just because you can only have one island per console  yeah it is annoying but is nothing compared to the greatness of this game 
2978,a fantastic game to play during quarantine  do not listen to the neck beard simp virgins review bombing this game
2979,my children were very interested in this game  my husband and i had never played any of the old versions of animal crossing  when i bought the game i was happy to see it was multiplayer m  up to 4 players  seemed like a great family game  my 7 year old  jumped right in  made his island  gave it a silly name  made his avatar  started playing  he loves it  then my 9 year old tried it  and wemy children were very interested in this game  my husband and i had never played any of the old versions of animal crossing  when i bought the game i was happy to see it was multiplayer m  up to 4 players  seemed like a great family game  my 7 year old  jumped right in  made his island  gave it a silly name  made his avatar  started playing  he loves it  then my 9 year old tried it  and we quickly learned that he could not make an island  he was devastated  as he d really wanted the game  too  he has no interest in playing as a minor character in what s now his brothers game  multiplayer is useless too  it is not even split iscreen  i really hope nintendo fixes this  expand
2980,highly frustrating and tedious user interface sure its a slow casual wind down game but u dont have to go as far as monologue after every action  also the chores u gotta do to add your friend ingame etc
2981,a good way to relax despite what s going on in the world at the moment to those people who are rating 0 because of the 1 island per switch policy  what s wrong with you p s  this review is mainly to combat the continuous review bombing 
2982,i wouldont mind the one island per console cause i own my own nintendo but as a fast paced player usually playing games like call of duty  pokemon etc etc i wouldo not find this game interesting to me  i know its made for everyone but now i am about 2 days in and have nothing to do its really boring  i have heard though you get interesting features within a week which isn t my thing but other peoplei wouldont mind the one island per console cause i own my own nintendo but as a fast paced player usually playing games like call of duty  pokemon etc etc i wouldo not find this game interesting to me  i know its made for everyone but now i am about 2 days in and have nothing to do its really boring  i have heard though you get interesting features within a week which isn t my thing but other people like  i am only giving a 5 because the graphics are nice and that its a relaxing game but way too slow paced for me to like but others do  anyways i am 50 50  expand
2983,cannot unlock terra forming because im not the island representative  why s this a feature  i quit the game because i would have to restart by buying the game again for a third time to get it right  absolute joke  there is no possible way for me to unlock terra forming without restarting 
2984,i set up this metacritic account just to write this review  in the hopes it will get nintendo s attention to correct this obvious flaw in animal crossing new horizons why is nothere only one island per console   this is an unforgivable sin in console gaming   please correct this obvious flaw immediately   we have multiple player profiles on the console  and would like to each have ouri set up this metacritic account just to write this review  in the hopes it will get nintendo s attention to correct this obvious flaw in animal crossing new horizons why is nothere only one island per console   this is an unforgivable sin in console gaming   please correct this obvious flaw immediately   we have multiple player profiles on the console  and would like to each have our own island   currently  only one of us can effectively play this game  with the other players in our home having to effectively just watch as the on mayor of the island plays the game correct this now we should be able to create multiple save games  and have multiple islands on a single switch console   otherwise  the game is effectively meaningless correct this now i am absolutely dumbfounded that nintendo decided to make this decision   i hope this issue is corrected quickly i am giving this game a zero score until this issue is corrected  expand
2985,this game has so much potential to entertain families buy it fails dramatically  trying to wrap my head around how nintendo thinks they will make more money from people buying completely new switches for each sibling to just play animal crossing is so absurd  i really want to play this game to its full potential and run my own island that isn t my brothers island who is now crying becausethis game has so much potential to entertain families buy it fails dramatically  trying to wrap my head around how nintendo thinks they will make more money from people buying completely new switches for each sibling to just play animal crossing is so absurd  i really want to play this game to its full potential and run my own island that isn t my brothers island who is now crying because he wants me off his island  i cant believe such a beutiful and sweet game can cause so much chaos  wow nintendo ya did it again  expand
2986,one island per switch  my girlfriend likes it because i gave her the island  i hate this game because as a second  player  i can do almost nothing 
2987,i got this game with my slightly smaller sister  we split the costs  and i wouldecided that for once  i would be nice and let her try this game out first  fully expecting that we both could have our own islands  turns out i was wrong  i spent 30 dollars of my own money for an experience that i will never have that my sister will  all because i was trying to be nice  this is a huge problem  andi got this game with my slightly smaller sister  we split the costs  and i wouldecided that for once  i would be nice and let her try this game out first  fully expecting that we both could have our own islands  turns out i was wrong  i spent 30 dollars of my own money for an experience that i will never have that my sister will  all because i was trying to be nice  this is a huge problem  and like many other negative reviews  i feel like the game is limiting me to a side character and nothing else  i still do not get why even on a system with a profile system nintendo would still put in the one island per console thing  expand
2988,unfortunately game is effectively unplayable due to being the second person trying to play on the switch  cannot even buy a second cartridge to play my own game 
2989,i took the game back and returned it the moment i saw you are not allowed to make multiple islands  the decision was not even greedy since pretty much no one is going to buy a new switch for that  it is just plain stupid and ruins fun for so many people 
2990,amazing  probably one of the best animal crossing since it was launched for the first time on the gamecube  you have a lot of liberty in this game  you can pretty much do whatever you want   compared to the previous titles  this game is perfect of you wanna have a good time or relax after work 
2991,me hacen gracia las notas bajas intentando desprestigiar a nintendo  yo soy usuario de ps también pero cuando un juego es una obra maestra se dice y punto 
2992,wanted to buy this for my family  but i will not unless they remove the one island per switch restriction 
2993,for those who say i wouldo not understand review bombing well try playing as villager b and come back
2994,1 island for console limitation i cannot play this game because my girlfriend has played 125 hours and i want my own new game fix that  
2995,per giocare con figli o fidanzate  mogli o persone del nucleo familiare  sappiate che ci vuole una console a testa perché una funzione base come quella di avere più salvataggi su un un unica console non c è nel 2020 sembra una barzelletta ma così non è  da appassionato di titoli nintendo  questa è una delusione amarissima  il gioco in se sarà anche bello ma togliermi la condivisione cheper giocare con figli o fidanzate  mogli o persone del nucleo familiare  sappiate che ci vuole una console a testa perché una funzione base come quella di avere più salvataggi su un un unica console non c è nel 2020 sembra una barzelletta ma così non è  da appassionato di titoli nintendo  questa è una delusione amarissima  il gioco in se sarà anche bello ma togliermi la condivisione che posso avere con qualcuno in casa quando giochiamo in orari wouldifferenti  in un tipo di gioco come questo  è a mio avviso gravemente penalizzante perché non si guarda a far felici i propri utenti che pagano volentieri i prodotti ama anzi  si spera di havendere altre console con mezzucci proprio raccapriccianti  expand
2996,one island per console is a pathetic limitation and i will endeavour never to purchase anything associated with the game  its developers or its brand  nintendo  too  shall be relegated to the dung heap of history as it was for me for decades before the switch gave compelling reason for me to consider them before this blatant compulsion to buy a second console for one games  ease of use 
2997,even though it iseems like a great game with many items and characters i am put of it by the fact that all people on one switch have to play the same island this makes the game less fun and is ea level of greediness
2998,game is fantastic nintendo deciding that you can only make one island per console basically makes me not want to play
